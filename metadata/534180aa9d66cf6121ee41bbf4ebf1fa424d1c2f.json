Gillian's father is in the hospital and Bob says he can babysit her kids Farren (Madeline Carroll), Ian (Will Shadley), and Nora (Alina Foley). Farren and Ian sneak into Bob's house and Ian downloads a top-secret formula from his computer. Bob's archenemy, a Russian terrorist named Anton Poldark, who developed a substance that dissolves petroleum, moves in to attack, forcing Bob to juggle the roles of spy and prospective stepfather in the most challenging mission of his career. Bob asks Colton James (Billy Ray Cyrus), his spy partner, to help him, but he is not sure if he can trust Colton. Matters are further complicated when a Russian spy, Larry (Lucas Till) attacks Bob, forcing him to tell the kids and Gillian that he is a spy. In addition, Bob learns that his boss, Glaze (George Lopez), is actually working for Poldark and the Russians due to that Poldark will destroy all the oil supply everywhere but Russia. Bob manages to escape and flees to Gillian's home. Soon, Poldark arrives and engages Bob in a fight with his henchmen. At the end the CIA come to arrest Poldark, Glaze, Larry, Creel and the rest of Poldark's team. Colton asks Glaze if the handcuffs were too tight and pushes him out. Bob then marries Gillian.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:534180aa9d66cf6121ee41bbf4ebf1fa424d1c2f","amp;dn":"Spy+Next+Door+DVDRIP+%7EPINKHONEY0269%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"534180aa9d66cf6121ee41bbf4ebf1fa424d1c2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,65,128,170,157,102,207,97,33,238,65,187,244,235,241,250,66,77,28,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
