It was the biggest hit off the album Law and Order, which was released in 1981. It was also Buckingham's first hit as a solo artist.\n\n&quot;Trouble&quot; was the only song on the album that Buckingham didn't play bass or drums on; his Fleetwood Mac bandmate Mick Fleetwood was brought in to do the drums. Things didn't work out very well in the recording session, and a taped loop of the drum track, about four-seconds long, was used over and over for the song.[1] The song is sung in a light falsetto.\n\nThe single would become a #9 hit in the US in early 1982. It topped the charts in Australia for 3 weeks.\n\nIn the UK, it was released on the Mercury Records label. It entered the UK singles charts on 16 January 1983, rising to a high of number 31, and it remained in the chart for 7 weeks.[2]\n\nThe distinctive music video for &quot;Trouble&quot; features a multi-instrumental &quot;big-band&quot; featuring a plethora of male musicians, including Mick Fleetwood.\n\nThe song appears in the film Just One of the Guys during the blind date.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22703759754423f41a37ac1b575eabf752ff104b","amp;dn":"LINDSEY+BUCKINGHAM+%281982%29+TROUBLE.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22703759754423f41a37ac1b575eabf752ff104b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,112,55,89,117,68,35,244,26,55,172,27,87,94,171,247,82,255,16,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
