FOR MUCH FASTER UPLOADS AND DOWNLOADS, INSTEAD OF UPLOADING UNTOUCHED DVD9'S, I AM NOW STRIPPING EVERYTHING BUT THE MAIN MOVIE (UNLESS THERE'S SOME REALLY AMAZING SPECIAL FEATURES, WHICH THERE USUALLY AREN'T). THE END PRODUCT IS THE SAME TYPE OF FILES, ENCODE WITH DVDSHRINK OR WHATEVER AS USUAL. PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COMMENT ON THE NEW FORMAT IF YOU HAVE AN OPINION. I THINK THAT SACRIFICING MENUS AND CRAPPY FEATURES IS WORTH IT FOR MAX QUALITY VIDEO ON A BLANK DVD5.\n\n\nKiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005)\n\nThis highly under-appreciated movie enjoys a lofty position as my second-favorite overall movie ever, behind only Tarantino's Pulp Fiction.  This movie is very much in that same vein of dark, twisty, dialogue driven storytelling, but with the incomparable Robert Downey Jr in the leading role.  If you are a fan of gangster pics, film noir or clever storytelling, you will not be disappointed.\n\nFormat: DVDR, NTSC, DVD9 (stripped)\n\nVideo:  Anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1)\n\nAudio:  English DD5.1; French DD5.1; Spanish DD5.1\n\nSubs:   English, French, Spanish\n\nSpecial Features: Removed\n\n\nCover:      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eabcBaADC&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/eabcBaADC&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nGreetings to all my fellow TPB users.  I am going to make an effort to upload dvds that I had a hard time finding, or ones that I just think are really cool, lol.  I hope you enjoy them.\n\nRemember, please SEED as long as you can after downloading!!!!\n\nAlso, check out these other dvd-r uploaders who do great work:\n\njackalope77   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/jackalope77/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/jackalope77/&lt;/a&gt;\nctang:        &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/ctang&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/ctang&lt;/a&gt;\ntater44:      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/tater44/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/tater44/&lt;/a&gt;\nSeedkey:      &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Seedkey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/Seedkey&lt;/a&gt;\t\nomegafox84:   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/user/omegafox84&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/user/omegafox84&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:108cc62d0fd2d45b8dccb0c2fcc20d2848d52d6f","amp;dn":"Kiss+Kiss+Bang+Bang+-%282005%29-NTSC-WS-Eng%2FFre%2FSpa-+%5Bjackalope77%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"108cc62d0fd2d45b8dccb0c2fcc20d2848d52d6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,140,198,45,15,210,212,91,141,204,176,194,252,194,13,40,72,213,45,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
