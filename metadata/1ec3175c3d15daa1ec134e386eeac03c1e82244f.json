If you're unsure        \nof which one to choose, just install &quot;Internet Security&quot;.\n\n(3)  Make sure you choose the right flavour (x86 or x64) for your  \nsystem.  Don't worry, if you pick the wrong one Windows will    \ntell you so.\n\n(4)  Double click on the installer or your choice and follow the      \nprompts.  If you are prompted to create or sign into a            \nBitDefender account, just make a throw-away email address and  \nuse that.\n\n(5)  Once the installation has finished restart your computer in    \n&quot;Safe Mode&quot;.  To start in &quot;Safe Mode&quot; press the F8 key when        \nyour computer starts to boot.  A menu will appear with several    \noptions.\n\n(6)  When your Desktop has started in &quot;Safe Mode&quot;, right click on    \n&quot;Box_BD2011.exe&quot; and choose &quot;Run as Administrator&quot;.                \n\n(7)  Click on the button marked &quot;Year 2047&quot;.  A dialogue will appear    \ntelling you that the operation was successful.                      \n\n(8)  Restart your PC again (in normal mode) and it should be done.  \n\n(9)  Make sure you update BitDefender and run a virus scan.    \n\nnote\nSome antivirus programs may claim that the keygen included    \nis a virus or trojan.  This is just a false positive, I've        \nscanned the file thoroughly and I have used it on my own PC.  \n\nIf you're still worried that this file may be infected and        \nyou don't want to take the risk, then I suggest you download  \na free antivirus product or purchase BitDefender.
