The album brought a first for the band: three number one R&amp;B singles from a single album. The songs &quot;Misled&quot; (Pop #10), &quot;Fresh&quot; (Pop #9, Dance #1), and &quot;Cherish&quot; (Pop #2) all hit the top spot in 1985. In addition, the title track was also released as a single, and reached the top twenty.\n\nKool &amp; The Gang are an American jazz, R&amp;B, soul, funk and disco group, originally formed in Jersey City, New Jersey in 1964.\n\nThey went through several musical phases during the course of their recording career, starting out with a purist jazz sound, then becoming practitioners of R&amp;B and funk, progressing to a smooth pop-funk ensemble, and in the post-millenium creating music with a modern, electro-pop sound.\n\nThey have sold over 70 million albums worldwide.\n\nThe late 1970s saw a lull in Kool &amp; the Gang's except for the album Open Sesame which yielded the title track &quot;Open Sesame&quot; which achieved some success in the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Then came new lead singer James &quot;J.T.&quot; Taylor who joined the group ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with 1979's Ladies' Night. Their #1 hit in 1980's &quot;Celebration&quot;, from Celebrate!, co-produced by Eumir Deodato. More international hits followed in the early 1980s, including &quot;Big Fun,&quot; &quot;Get Down on It&quot; and &quot;Joanna&quot;. Their 1984 album Emergency yielded four top-20 pop hits, including &quot;Fresh&quot; and &quot;Cherish.&quot; Their chart presence stopped after Forever. Taylor left the group amicably to pursue a solo career.\n\n&quot;Jungle Boogie&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of Quentin Tarantino's well known cult classic Pulp Fiction. The band released the album &quot;Still Kool&quot; in 2007.\n\n&quot;Hollywood Swinging&quot; was sampled by DJ Kool in his song &quot;Let Me Clear My Throat&quot;, and by rapper Mase on &quot;Feel So Good.&quot;\n\nKool &amp; The Gang's &quot;Summer Madness&quot; from their 1974 album Light of Worlds has been sampled numerous times. Most notably, it was used by DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince for their 1991 single &quot;Summertime.&quot; &quot;Summer Madness&quot; was also featured in the 1976 Picture of the Year, &quot;Rocky.&quot; A live version of the track recorded at the Rainbow Theatre in London was released in 1976 on the Love &amp; Understanding album (De-Lite DEP 2018). Live at PJ's' track &quot;N.T&quot; has been sampled extensively by artists such as Boogie Down Productions, Brand Nubian, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, N.W.A and Kris Kross.\n\nKool &amp; The Gang performed at Jerusalem's Gan Sacher (Sacher Park) during the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Student Day/Jerusalem Day all-night concert on May 11ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“12, 2010. In October 2010, Kool &amp; The Gang signed with indie label Expat Records for the release of their electro-pop single &quot;Miss Lead&quot; with a female lead vocalist.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5003a876c555d36d7bb5f0cef42ed7d8e49e297c","amp;dn":"Kool+%26+The+Gang+-+Misled+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5003a876c555d36d7bb5f0cef42ed7d8e49e297c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,3,168,118,197,85,211,109,123,181,240,206,244,46,215,216,228,158,41,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
