The band was at the peak of its popularity in the mid-to-late 1990s; its members have moved on to other projects.\n\nThe brother duo of drummer Christian and guitarist Jagori Tanna (a stage name adopted through an admiration for Carlos Santana) met vocalist Edwin at their shared Toronto rehearsal space in 1990. Edwin asked the brothers to form a band with him, and the three came together in 1991, taking on Franz Masini as a bass player. The band came up with the name IME, as in &quot;I Am Me&quot;, but later decided the letters should stand for something. Jag Tanna ad-libbed the name I Mother Earth and has always insisted it has no special meaning. The band, represented by a professionally-recorded five-song demo, played a mere thirteen shows over the next year. These were noted for their jam sessions, poetry readings, and murals painted in the background during the songs. At the end of the year, the band was in the middle of a bidding war between labels. IME ended up being signed to EMI in Canada, and Capitol for the U.S. and internationally.\n\nI Mother Earth travelled to Los Angeles in 1992 to record its debut album with former Guns N' Roses producer Mike Clink. During these sessions, Franz Masini was fired, leaving Jag Tanna to re-record the bass parts by himself. At the completion of the album, Masini was replaced by Bruce Gordon, whose band Rocktopus was breaking up at that time. With the lineup solidified, the band underwent an intensive international tour to support its debut, Dig, in mid-1993. Considered an anomaly in the &quot;alternative&quot; era and often mistaken for heavy metal, the album combined traditional hard rock with grooves, extended jams, psychedelic lyrics, and the Latin-based percussion of Luis Conte and Armando Borg. Dig spawned four singles, the first three of which actually originated from IME's demo tape and were later included on the proper album. &quot;Rain Will Fall&quot; and &quot;Not Quite Sonic&quot; were released in the summer of 1993, and &quot;So Gently We Go&quot; and &quot;Levitate&quot; were released the following summer. All four garnered respectable radio and video airplay in Canada, as well as rotations in the U.S. and Europe. The latter two singles in particular charted well on Canadian rock radio. The album itself won a Juno Award in 1994 for Best Hard Rock Album, beating out IME's childhood idols Rush for the award. This cemented a long relationship between the two bands, which started with IME opening for Rush the night after the Junos. By the end of the album's run, Dig was a Gold record in Canada.\n\nAfter the exhaustive touring ended, IME ended up in different studios in Toronto and Morin Heights, Quebec in 1995. In these studios, the band worked on its second album, co-produced by Jag Tanna and Paul Northfield, who was most noted for producing Rush. Daniel Mansilla replaced Borg on percussion, and became the band's permanent touring percussionist. Rush guitarist Alex Lifeson also made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Like a Girl&quot;. However, signs of dissension in the band were already showing. For the first time, Edwin revealed to the music press that he had no creative control in the band and that such a situation gave him &quot;no reason to be (t)here&quot;. He had also spent a great deal of the sessions away from the band, recording the album Victor with Lifeson. Still, he remained with IME as the group recorded Scenery and Fish, released in mid-1996. The album, which combined IME's trademark sounds with a slightly softer, radio-friendly approach, was a critical and commercial success. In particular, the singles &quot;One More Astronaut&quot; and &quot;Another Sunday&quot; pushed the band into the commercial elite in Canada, the former cracking the Top 20 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart in the U.S. Subsequent singles &quot;Used to Be Alright&quot; and &quot;Raspberry&quot; also made solid showings on radio and video. In 1997, IME was nominated for a Juno Award for Group of the Year. The album was nominated for the Best Rock Album Juno, and was a double Platinum record in Canada. The band's new found fame also pushed sales of Dig over the Platinum record mark. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDig 1993\n\n\nDig is the debut album by the Canadian alternative rock band I Mother Earth, released by Capitol and EMI on August 10, 1993. It went gold in Canada in its initial run, and today stands at platinum in Canada.[1] It also won a Juno Award in 1994 for Best Hard Rock Album.[2]\n\nThe album was noted for its metallic sound, balanced with psychedelic-style lyrics and instrumentals, and further backed by Latin percussion. The latter two were often brought into play during lengthy jam sessions.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;The Mothers&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n2.\t&quot;Levitate&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n3.\t&quot;Rain Will Fall&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:18\n4.\t&quot;So Gently We Go&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:04\n5.\t&quot;Not Quite Sonic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:55\n6.\t&quot;Production&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:00\n7.\t&quot;Lost My America&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:29\n8.\t&quot;No One&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:56\n9.\t&quot;Undone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n10.\t&quot;Basketball&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:12\n11.\t&quot;And the Experience&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:54\n12.\t&quot;The Universe in You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenery &amp; Fish 1996\n\n\nScenery and Fish is the second album by the Canadian alternative rock band I Mother Earth, released by Capitol and EMI on July 9, 1996. It was the band's most commercially successful work, going double platinum in Canada.[1]\n\nThe album was somewhat of a continuance of the band's percussive, psychedelic sound, albeit this time with more of a post-grunge twist tinged with elements of both progressive rock and pop.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Hello Dave!&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:47\n2.\t&quot;Like a Girl&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:40\n3.\t&quot;One More Astronaut&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:24\n4.\t&quot;Another Sunday&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:05\n5.\t&quot;Three Days Old&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47\n6.\t&quot;Used to be Alright&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:27\n7.\t&quot;Shortcut to Moncton&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:56\n8.\t&quot;Pisser&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:00\n9.\t&quot;Raspberry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:45\n10.\t&quot;Songburst &amp; Delirium&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:55\n11.\t&quot;Sense of Henry&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:16\n12.\t&quot;Earth, Sky &amp; C&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:06\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue Green Orange 1999\n\n\nBlue Green Orange is the third album by the Canadian alternative rock band I Mother Earth, released by Universal on July 13, 1999. Featuring album covers in blue, green, or orange, the album went gold in Canada.[1]\n\nThe album, while still in the vein of the prior jam-oriented albums, was mellower and offered several twists. These included tribal rhythms, computerized loops, instrumental elements similar to modern indie rock, and the debut of Brian Byrne on lead vocals.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Love Your Starfish&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:56\n2.\t&quot;All Awake&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:13\n3.\t&quot;Gargantua&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n4.\t&quot;When Did You Get Back from Mars?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:02\n5.\t&quot;Summertime in the Void&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:03\n6.\t&quot;Good for Sule&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:35\n7.\t&quot;Cloud Pump&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n8.\t&quot;Blacksox&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:44\n9.\t&quot;Autumn on Drugs&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:41\n10.\t&quot;Infinity Machine&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:26\n11.\t&quot;My Beautiful Deep End&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Quicksilver Meat Dream 2003\n\n\nThe Quicksilver Meat Dream is officially the fourth album [1] by the Canadian alternative rock band I Mother Earth, released by Universal on April 8, 2003. It is allegedly a concept album, though the details on the concept are left to the fans.[1] It is the final album from the band.\n\nThe album retained the instrumental jams and cryptic lyrics of prior albums, but largely strayed from the band's psychedelic past. Instead, it offered a dark modern metal sound with industrial elements, and at times the band's greatest emphasis on progressive rock to date.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;0157:H7&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n2.\t&quot;Choke&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:18\n3.\t&quot;I is Us&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n4.\t&quot;God Rocket (Into the Heart of Las Vegas)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:49\n5.\t&quot;Like the Sun&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n6.\t&quot;Hell &amp; Malfunction&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:01\n7.\t&quot;Soft Bomb Salad&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:38\n8.\t&quot;Juicy&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n9.\t&quot;No Coma&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n10.\t&quot;Meat Dreams&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:19 \ni.)

He was on the band's first two albums, and was also on the majority of the songs on Victor, a 1996 side project from Alex Lifeson of Rush. He went solo in late 1997 and released three albums from 1999 to 2006. He is currently the lead singer for the newly formed Canadian super group Crash Karma. Also, he currently is a bartender at Tattoo Rock Parlour in Toronto, Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Spin Around the Sun 1999\n\n\nAnother Spin Around the Sun is the debut solo album by Canadian alternative rock musician Edwin. It was released on April 27, 1999 in Canada, and July 4, 2000 in the United States. The album marked a musical change in his career from his previous work with I Mother Earth, being more pop-oriented. It spawned five singles &quot;Trippin'&quot;, &quot;Hang Ten&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;And You&quot;, and &quot;Rush&quot;. The album went Platinum in Canada[1] and was nominated for a Juno Award for Best Rock album in 2000.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Theories&quot; (Edwin, David Martin)[disambiguation needed] ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:36\n2.\t&quot;Trippin'&quot; (Edwin, Martin, Ben Dunk) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n3.\t&quot;Hang Ten&quot; (Edwin, Martin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:32\n4.\t&quot;And You&quot; (Edwin, Jack Blades, Jim Huff) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:59\n5.\t&quot;Screaming Kings&quot; (Edwin, John Keller) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:22\n6.\t&quot;Shotgun&quot; (Edwin, Ruben Huizenga) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:38\n7.\t&quot;Alive&quot; (Edwin, Martin, Stephan Moccio) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:10\n8.\t&quot;Rush&quot; (Edwin, Matt DeMatteo, Martin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n9.\t&quot;Amazing&quot; (Edwin, Huizenga) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:09\n10.\t&quot;Take Me Anywhere&quot; (Edwin, Huizenga) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n11.\t&quot;Better Than This&quot; (Edwin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n12.\t&quot;Another Drink (Hidden Track)&quot; (Edwin, DeMatteo) - 2:35\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdwin &amp; The Pressure 2002\n\n\nEdwin &amp; the Pressure is the second album by the Canadian alternative rock singer Edwin, released by Sony on April 2, 2002 in Canada. Though technically his second solo album, Edwin himself considered it a debut for his then-new band.\n\nThe album continued the pop-oriented, electronically flavored style of the previous album. However, the sound was heavier and more guitar-dominated, and the lyrics were more explicit than before.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\n1.\t&quot;Superhoney&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n2.\t&quot;The One That Got Away&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:28\n3.\t&quot;Impossible&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n4.\t&quot;High&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n5.\t&quot;Firecracker&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:02\n6.\t&quot;Malibu Sunset&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n7.\t&quot;Painkiller&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:48\n8.\t&quot;Let's Dance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:27\n9.\t&quot;Surround Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n10.\t&quot;Split The Atom&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter Days 2006\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n\nNever Over\nWrong Side\nI Wonder\nRight Here\nFlyin'\nBetter Days\nThat's a Lie\nLight Reflects\nEyes of a Child\nHold Your Head Up\nAlive (Acoustic)\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fba04a675415af0ca7203459d04160bf8fee3923","amp;dn":"I+Mother+Earth+%26+Edwin+-+Studio+Discography+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fba04a675415af0ca7203459d04160bf8fee3923","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,160,74,103,84,21,175,12,167,32,52,89,208,65,96,191,143,238,57,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
