You can still find the cds from $60-$90 though.  The band had some conflict with Sony and their music was never released digitally.  Ive never seen these albums uploaded anywhere.\n\nThe vinyl is 30 years old and has been played on many of my turntables through the years so its not in pristine condition.\n\nClassic 80s New Wave/Pop.\n\nI can upload this in FLAC if anyone is interested. Just let me know.\n\nNo voodoo computer post-processing hiss, cick/pop, music removal programs were used... I sat there and inserted a track number during the recording.  Ripped with EAC and converted to MP3 (320kps) using Switch Sound Plus.\n\nThis is for my Brother and the memory of NC, TCBY and Nakamichi.......\n\nEquipment used:  \n\nLinn LP12 turntable, Linn Ittok LV II tonearm, Linn K18 cartridge, Linn LK1 preamp, Cardas Quadlink 5C RCA cable, Pioneer PDR 609 cd recorder, Verbatim Vibe Music CDR.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed2e072b45fde80173d9f44723f78efaede059b1","amp;dn":"THE+PRODUCERS+First+Two+Albums+%28LINN+LP12+VINYL%2C+320kps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed2e072b45fde80173d9f44723f78efaede059b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,46,7,43,69,253,232,1,115,217,244,71,35,247,142,250,237,224,89,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
