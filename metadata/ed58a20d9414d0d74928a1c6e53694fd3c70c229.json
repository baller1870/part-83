After a few days and nights of mysterious lights and noises, a giant machine comes out of the ocean. The machine is the creation of an alien race, that is trying to syphon energy from earth. A true classic, in that it is so different from anything in the time period. To this day, nothing else has come out like it.\n\n\nA giant asteroid nearly five miles wide crashes into the ocean near Mexico. A trio of scientists, led by Les Gaskell, investigate, and discover a giant machine. Meanwhile, a colleague of the scientists has been possessed by an alien electricity, and is controlling the actions of a 100-foot-tall robot, which is heading for Los Angeles and destroying all in its path.\n\nComplete credited cast:  \n Jeff Morrow ....
