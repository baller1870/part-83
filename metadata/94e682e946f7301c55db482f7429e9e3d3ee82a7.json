We are currently testing and hope to announce the official release shortly. There are also plans to make LT firmware for the older Hitachi drives but without Ap25 as itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not required. LT+ for Slims is the priority at the moment. FYI iXtreme 1.51 still works just fine with AP25 (many are still using the older HitachiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on XBL ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ however we canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t guarantee that it is XBL safe so use at your own risk).\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94e682e946f7301c55db482f7429e9e3d3ee82a7","amp;dn":"C4E%5C%27s+iXtreme+LT%2B+v1.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94e682e946f7301c55db482f7429e9e3d3ee82a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,230,130,233,70,247,48,28,85,219,72,47,116,41,233,227,211,238,130,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
