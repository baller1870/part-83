After a scathing review from food critic JT Franks causes chef Peter Grey to lose his job at his restaurant, and the cancellation of his show, Grey kidnaps Franks and the torture begins. It sounds pretty cheesy but Grey reads reviews Franks has given and forces him to do better in order to eat the food he is preparing. The movie is slow moving in parts but overall a pretty good movie to watch. I was going to give it a B- mainly because the torture movie genre is all the same, but the last 20 minutes strayed away from the aspects that made this seem different and into &quot;really, they are doing this??!&quot;.The ending brought the grade down, it could have been so much better.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7730baaf37801b3c2d415dff1926f81593aea48","amp;dn":"Bitter+Feast+2010+%5BDVDRip.XviD-miguel%5D+%5BENG%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7730baaf37801b3c2d415dff1926f81593aea48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,115,11,170,243,120,1,179,194,212,21,223,241,146,111,129,89,58,234,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
