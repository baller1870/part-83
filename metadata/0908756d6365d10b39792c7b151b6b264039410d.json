The Water Is Washing Over Me  \n11. Lonely Times  \n\nUpon first listen, &quot;Paramour&quot; had an Emmylou Harris, &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot; feel to it---then I was to find out it was produced by Mark Howard, a Lanois prodigy. Ah-ha, so there you go.... \n\nWistful, weeping guitar, deep rhythms, and rich vocals infuse the tracks on &quot;Paramour.&quot; This is stirring, bucolic music that seeps inside and possesses you. While the mood remains a constant through-line, the feel varies: &quot;Blue River&quot; is bluesy and soulful; &quot;The Ballad of Padre Miguel&quot; has a Latin flavor; and &quot;Rosa Marie&quot; is deep and penetrating in its sensual, pleading story. \n\n&quot;Paramour&quot; pulls from various traditions, sounds, and influences (you'll hear a little bit of U2, a touch of Neil Young, some Dylan here and there, a bit of Emmylou, Chris Isaak and Old West and an occasional hue of P.J. Harvey) but DEADMAN has a sound and feel that is very much its own: at the same time ghostly and romantic; creating a dynamic, and complex feel, likening to an old western flick filmed in the middle of autumn, and taking a old horse down a lost highway. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0908756d6365d10b39792c7b151b6b264039410d","amp;dn":"Deadman...Paramour%282001%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0908756d6365d10b39792c7b151b6b264039410d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,8,117,109,99,101,209,11,57,121,44,123,21,27,107,38,64,57,65,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
