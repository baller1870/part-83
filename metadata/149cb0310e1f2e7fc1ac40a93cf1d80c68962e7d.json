Regardless of their pedigree, each piece has a certain latent possibility\nburied within it. Kornstad and Wiik's efforts are directed towards exposing the\ninner workings of these marvelous compositions; saying, in effect, &quot;This is what\nthey are really about.&quot;\n\nEschewing any kind of studio magic, the duo is recorded very dryly, which is\nheard as an extension of their respective musical personalities. Kornstad uses a\nthin but focused tone with little airiness or vibrato, and stays mostly in\nhigher range of the tenor saxophone. Wiik's touch is very delicate and spare,\nleaving lots of space. His playing might be heard as that of a modern Teddy\nWilson, whose notes have been described as strings of pearls.\n\nThe immediacy and directness of the sound adds to the emotional impact of the\nalbum, which accumulates over the course of the tunes. The effect, as on the\nprevious album, is subtle and beautiful, without a hint of the bombastic. They\nare playing to each other and for themselves, creating an air of\nintimacy. Thankfully, we get to hear it.\n\n&quot;Embraceable You,&quot; by George Gershwin, will most surely be recognized by anyone\nfamiliar with the Great American Songbook. The deconstruction of the tune is\nremarkable and touches on the question every improviser asks: &quot;What is the\nessence of this tune?&quot; Listening to this track is to understand what the tune is\nabout emotionally as well as musically, as they reference it continually without\never actually playing it.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum is Graham Nash's &quot;Lady Of The Island,&quot; one of\nthe high points of the album Crosby, Stills And Nash (Atlantic, 1969). This\nremarkable composition, that mixes poetry with floating, beautiful harmonies, is\nalso taken apart and presented anew to the listener, who will never hear the\noriginal again in the same way. It would not be surprising if this track is\npicked up by others and the tune becomes a standard.\n\nThat the album is named after a David Raksin compositionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a writer best known for\nhis film scores, and especially for Laura (1944), the theme of which became a\nhit with lyrics by Johnny MercerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is telling. Time literally stops, as Wiik plays\nthe slow arpeggios that announce the gossamer harmonies; the track is five\nminutes of heaven.\n\nThe Bad And The Beautiful rates another heartfelt bravo!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:149cb0310e1f2e7fc1ac40a93cf1d80c68962e7d","amp;dn":"Hakon+Kornstad+%26+Havard+Wiik+-+The+Bad+And+The+Beautiful+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"149cb0310e1f2e7fc1ac40a93cf1d80c68962e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,156,176,49,14,31,46,127,193,172,64,169,60,241,216,12,104,150,46,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
