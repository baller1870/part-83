He pisses off the fans of James Rolfe for two years (I think) using the name AVGN.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nSome funny facts about Jaakko:\n- He wanted to become youtube partner to fund World Parrot Trust\n(http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/6799/youtubeandparrotsflvsna.jpg)\n- Besides of course Finnish he knows German and English and I think Japanese languages\n- He hates Sonic, though he likes anime and manga\n- He's composer and makes introduction music in his reviewing-videos\n- He made a song and wanted famous internet people to sing it in chorus, so he sended e-mail to James Rolfe, president of Estonia, Spoony, Lowtax, moot and others asking them to join:\n(http://img827.imageshack.us/img827/2436/christmassongprojectflv.jpg)\nand he got the answer only from cabinet of Estonian president:\n(http://img576.imageshack.us/img576/2436/christmassongprojectflv.jpg)\nso Jaakko had to sing it alone\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nSome unneeded info:\nI used this torrent (google &quot;Jaakko - Isvaffel - S4t4nmaster - 628 Video Virtual Library&quot;) as starting point and downloaded all other his AVGN-videos from his current youtube channel with 480p quality till 24th of December 2010.\nNow we've got 868 episodes of his great and original show, plus 24 episodes of his Let's Play &quot;Zelda - Ocarina of Time&quot;.\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nSome bonuses:\n\nDVD cover-art\nhttp://img574.imageshack.us/img574/4802/avgn.jpg\n\nJaakko cosplaying as Nostalgia Critic\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/3876/jaakkonc.jpg\n\n~~~~~~~\n\nMerry Christmas, Jaakko's fans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67f66a8ef4c686b981ed65e80164e33dba1698f5","amp;dn":"Finnish+Angry+Video+Game+Nerd+-+1svaffel+-+Jaakko+Petteri+Jarvin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67f66a8ef4c686b981ed65e80164e33dba1698f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,246,106,142,244,198,134,185,129,237,101,232,1,100,227,61,186,22,152,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
