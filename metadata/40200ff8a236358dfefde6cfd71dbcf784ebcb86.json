Spread it! Let's take Charlie's advice seriously!\n\nDisgusting occurances are taking place in such a quick succession and show routinely that we are getting immunised even to registering shocks.\n\nThough gregarious by nature, the human race stands divided. We do not mix up with each other freely.\n\nAs a result, there is no mutual love and sympathy, no reciprocal respect.\n\nLack of respect breeds distrust which ultimately culminates in hatred and consequent violence all around, alienating man from man.\n\nLoss of love is the root cause of a crash of human values and eventually erupts into the form of tension, discord and suffering.\n\nOne is bewildered as to what is going to become of the world. \n\nWe have to reverse the gear from violence to love and peace, by realizing the Fatherhood of God, the by-products of which is the spontaneous brother-hood of mankind.\n\nIt is possible to realize the prospect of a world family with the unifying bond of love among its members in the wake of realisation of fatherhood of God only.\n\nThe apostles laboured hard, the martyrs died in torment, the scholars and the scientists proclaimed the beauties of higher life, the sociologists untiringly inculcated the sense of duties of good citizen, the philosophers pioneered sublime thoughts, and all agreed that God is one and that man's first duty is to realize Him. He is the key to Universal Brotherhood.\n\nUniversal Brotherhood is THE way of LIFE. It is an essential part of the very conduct and behaviour of any man, who feels at home in any part of the world. \n\nHe finds himself surrounded by his own people, his own fellow-beings, wherever he goes.\n\nThere is no stranger for him. For him it is one house, one goal, one BIG family.\n\nI thank everybody who has in some way contributed and is still contributing to the awakening of the human race, may all of you receive eternal reward in paradise.\n\nAll that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing!\n\n===================================================================================\n\nRemember: We are Stuarts here on earth, they are few and we are many - it is our God given responsibility!\n\n===================================================================================\n\nLet us all unite!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40200ff8a236358dfefde6cfd71dbcf784ebcb86","amp;dn":"BOOTLEG+-+Freedomfighter+-+Thus+spoke+Sir+Charles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40200ff8a236358dfefde6cfd71dbcf784ebcb86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,32,15,248,162,54,53,141,254,253,230,207,215,29,188,247,132,235,203,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
