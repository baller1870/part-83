This\nis mainstream jazz with an open mind, and Drechsler makes something unique out\nof his debut album. His bass clarinet indeed touches upon the extremes of human\nemotions, between sadness and hope, between melancholia and joy. Again, I will\ntake Myriam Alter's album &quot;If&quot; as a reference : a chamber-like atmosphere, a\nlightness of touch, carefully crafted compositions, excellent interplay,\nbeautiful melodies, a sense of fragility throughout, and a sadness, sadness,\nsadness, .... just listen to &quot;For Andy&quot;, or &quot;Graceful Touch&quot;, &quot;OSK&quot;, it will\nmake you break to pieces when listening to it. This is jazz with an interesting\nmix of European urban folk or street music with an American blues feeling, very\nmuch in the vain of Gianluigi Trovesi or Tomasz Stanko. The band members are\ntruly excellent, with Tord Gustavsen on piano, Oliver Steger on bass, JÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rg\nMikula on drums and Peter Ponger on piano on two tracks. Great music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82aa0ae2443cf0f39c86615eecfc4f51ff50ca4f","amp;dn":"Ulrich+Drechsler+Quartet+-+Humans+%26+Places+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82aa0ae2443cf0f39c86615eecfc4f51ff50ca4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,170,10,226,68,60,240,243,156,134,97,94,236,252,79,81,255,80,202,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
