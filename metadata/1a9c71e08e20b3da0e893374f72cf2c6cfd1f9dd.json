It is a 4,3 Gb compilation, so it fits into a single layer DVD.\nIt has been encoded using MPEG2 for video and AC3 5.1 codec for audio (upmixed from stereo source).\nThis is not a true multicam video. Well, really it is a &quot;cam-per-song&quot; video.\nLet me explain what I have done (more or less):\nI have taken from YouTube one HD video for each song, and have synchronized them with achtung_baby01's audio.\nOnce I had all the videos with the same audio standard, I have edited a whole concert track with all the parts.\nI decided to do this firstly in HD because nowadays everybody has nice HD TVs, and I saw nice HD sources in YouTube.\nApart, I have compiled it into this standard DVD format, as surely a lot of people will be asking for it.\nBy the way, I want to thank to everybody uploading videos in such quality! Maybe you will see your video inside my edition...\nOf course, many thanks to achtung_baby01 too, for sharing (and giving me his permission to use) his nice audio.\nAll taken videos were 720p videos, but unfortunately not all of them were of good good quality.\nFor example, not all of them were 30fps, and first 50 seconds of &quot;Get On Your Boots&quot; were not available in HD.\nAlso, some intervals between songs are a bit short. But well, in the end this is not a professional video.\nI decided to encode it as NTSC because I liked to have a (near) 30fps video, rather than the 25fps of a PAL compilation.\nAlso, I haven't put any kind of menu. I have preferred to fill the entire DVD with a single film.\nHowever, you can move or jump to the different songs, as they're different chapters.\nI'm sure that you will like it, specially if you were there, like me!\n\nSetlist (available chapters):\n\n-- Intro\n00 Space Oddity\n01 Return Of The Stingray Guitar\n02 Beautiful Day\n03 New Year's Day\n04 Get On Your Boots\n05 Magnificent\n06 Mysterious Ways\n07 Elevation\n08 Until The End Of The World\n09 I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\n10 North Star (An Acoustic Version)\n11 Mercy\n12 In A Little While\n13 Miss Sarajevo\n14 City Of Blinding Lights\n15 Vertigo\n16 I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight (Remix)\n17 Sunday Bloody Sunday\n18 MLK\n19 Walk On\n20 One\n21 Where The Streets Have No Name\n22 Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\n23 With Or Without You\n24 Moment Of Surrender\n-- Outro\n\nFeel free to share this creation: Enjoy and... let enjoy!\n\nTangRaM\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9fabebfef1f8edfef2dff8f2fef6f3b1fcf0f2b1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tangram.dyndns.org/u2-seville&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tangram.dyndns.org/u2-seville&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9c71e08e20b3da0e893374f72cf2c6cfd1f9dd","amp;dn":"2010-09-30+U2+at+Seville+%28DVD+edited+by+TangRaM%29+What+a+wonderfu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9c71e08e20b3da0e893374f72cf2c6cfd1f9dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,156,113,224,142,32,179,218,14,137,51,116,247,44,242,198,207,209,249,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
