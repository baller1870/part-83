Working alongside producer John Shanks (Take That, Backstreet Boys, Bon Jovi), the band's contemporary pop sound has evolved, whilst retaining their emotive ballad style. The album title came from a fan's suggestion on Twitter of using a lyric from first single 'Safe', which was subsequently adopted by the band. \n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n\n1.
