Top of the Pops, also known as TOTP, is a music chart television program, made by the BBC and originally broadcast weekly from 1 January 1964 to 30 July 2006. \n\nEach weekly program consisted of performances from some of that week's best-selling popular music artists, with a rundown of that week's singles chart. Additionally, every year there was a special edition of the program on Christmas Day featuring some of the best-selling singles of the year.\n\n&quot;Showdown&quot; is a song written by Jeff Lynne and recorded by the Electric Light Orchestra.\n\nIt was the band's last contemporary recording to be released on the Harvest label. In the US, the song was included on the album On The Third Day (1973), however in the UK the song was omitted from the album and would later be featured on their first compilation album , also called Showdown a year later instead. In 2006 the remastered issue of On the Third Day would feature the song on the album on both sides of the Atlantic for the first time. \n\nThe song was a change of pace for ELO, with a funkier backbeat. It was a favourite record of John Lennon's at the time, who dubbed them &quot;Son of Beatles&quot; in a US radio interview.\n(video has a red oval &quot;BNN&quot; logo at the top left &amp; a white semi-transparent &quot;2&quot; logo at the top right)\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showdown_(Electric_Light_Orchestra_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showdown_(Electric_Light_Orchestra_song)&lt;/a&gt;  \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_of_the_Pops&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haAmBAaDL&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haAmBAaDL&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6790kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:35\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
