Thats the question Joe Mantegna asks in this movie\nas articulated in the interview we have here included for you as a \n&quot;DVD extra&quot;. We tried previously to upconvert this to higher res -\nhowever it hust wanst bit rate rich enough and so Im sorry we tried.\nHere we bring you tehe right 720 X 480 res instead wih 192k audio too.\nIts not bluray - however I promise you that will happen as soon as possible\nto do.\n\nThis is a truly great movie to see. Lindsay Crouse is a gentle soul who is\ntaken for a bit of a ride by characters who are in fact alienated from her Christianly spirit. She may seem tough on the exterior at times, however\nthat is mere defensiveness she has learned as a coping mechanism in what\nhas been her world. Joe Mantegna is magnificent, seeming to want to be a\nnice guy while having instincts he cannot control at the root of his \ncharacter in this very fine movie.\n\nThere are twists and turns which will astound you and the suspense \nis captivating and thrilling. It really is a movie worth seeing and \nowning in your personal library, worthy of a cult following even. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093223/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093223/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf psychological drama and suspense is your thing, and you enjoy an\nintelligent uptake on it, grab this one while we await the bluray vers.\n\nWhile we do have a French version of this movie too, we are uncertain of\nits base of seeds here that we had years ago - same goes for the lovely\nbluray HD version of Reds we have that is dubbed in Russian. We do hope there\nis some interest in that too. However we have many others ready to go for \nwhich we know there should be great support. Our Das Boot (currently showing\nzero seeds/peers on the board here due to a glitch of some sort) got about 70 completions reasonably quickly done, and its still seeding the folks right now\nin fact with peers still joining the queue.\n\nWe are speaking to top management of the local phone company for a special deal\nas they once said they might get us fiber optic here even though the area is yet\nto be serviced with it broadly speaking. There were some issues involved\nin our previous dsl service and they indicated then they might just make\nit happen for us - it would replace 50 seeders or more just to have one\nmodem on fiber optic compared to cable or dsl service. we are already at the\nmaximum speed for cable in this country and so fiber optic will have to save\nthe day, given we have a great deal yet to accomplish inclusing our mp3s and\nkaraoke - we never want anyone to miss a seed - if we can at all help it!\n\nWe have about a dozen classics in best seller bluray converts - \nwe havent even launched yet!\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9475acc839dc274b6e0c1b28ef3c1a0550c23ed8","amp;dn":"The+House+of+Games+1987++%281.3GB+DivX%29+++moviesbyrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9475acc839dc274b6e0c1b28ef3c1a0550c23ed8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,117,172,200,57,220,39,75,110,12,27,40,239,60,26,5,80,194,62,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
