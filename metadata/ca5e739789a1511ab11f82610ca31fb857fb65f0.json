I have lost track of which of these are my rips, and which I got from other sources.  Everything is confirmed to be in .flac format.  All of the albums are here with the MFSL presented separately.  UABRS has some alternate edits from the Australian release.  I believe that I have all of the singles released from the various albums.  They are in separate folders.   An example of cuts you won't find anywhere else include the alternate mixes of &quot;A Sort Of Homecoming&quot;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ and &quot;Love Comes Tumbling&quot;\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ from the Australian &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; single.  All of the fan club only releases are represented.   My connection is not the fastest, so please bear with the upload, and please seed when done.  Comments are appreciated.  My next release will be a collection of U2 concerts recorded either from soundboards or broadcasts ranging from 1979 to the present day.   \n\n===============================================================\nALBUMS:\n1980 - Boy\n1981 - October\n1983 - War\n1983 - War (MFSL)\n1983 - Under A Blood Red Sky (alternate cuts included)\n1984 - The Unforgettable Fire\n1984 - The Unforgettable Fire (MFSL)\n1987 - The Joshua Tree\n1987 - The Joshua Tree (MFSL)\n1991 - Achtung Baby\n1993 - Zooropa\n1995 - Passengers - OST\n1997 - POP\n2000 - All That You Can't Leave Behind\n2000 - The Million Dollar Hotel - OST\n2002 - Best of 1980-1990\n2002 - The B-Sides 1980-1990\n2002 - Best Of 1990-2000\n2002 - The B-Sides 1990-2000\n2004 - How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb\n2006 - 18 Singles\n2007 - The Joshua Tree Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2008 - Boy Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2008 - October Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2008 - War Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2009 - The Unforgettable Fire Deluxe Edition (Disc 2)\n2009 - No Line On The Horizon\n\nEPs:\n1985 - Wide Awake In America\n2002 - 7\n2010 - Wide Awake In Europe\n\nFAN CLUB RELEASES:\n1995 - Melon\n2000 - Hasta La Vista Baby!\n2005 - Communication\n2006 - Zoo TV Live\n2007 - Go Home - Live from Slane Castle\n2009 - U2 Medium, Rare &amp; Remastered\n2010 - Artificial Horizon\n\nAll of the singles from all of the albums \n\n\nNOTE: For my vinyl rips, I do not apply any sort of filtering, so you may hear a few clicks. \n\nAll of these are tagged with appropriate artwork.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5e739789a1511ab11f82610ca31fb857fb65f0","amp;dn":"U2+-+The+Ultimate+FLAC+Collection+%28by+Entropy%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5e739789a1511ab11f82610ca31fb857fb65f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,94,115,151,137,161,81,26,177,31,130,97,12,163,31,184,87,251,101,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
