Produced by Filmation, Groovie Goolies was a spinoff of Sabrina the Teenage Witch (itself a spinoff of The Archie Show). Like most Saturday morning animated series of the era, Groovie Goolies contained an adult laugh track.\n\nThe Goolies were a group of hip monsters, many of whom were, in look and sound, pop-culture echoes of the classic horror-film monsters created in the 1930s and 1940s, mostly by Universal Pictures. The group sang a pop song each episode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9509a73b7dd89724a9a254dfada285b2368c653f","amp;dn":"The+Groovie+Goolies+complete+season","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9509a73b7dd89724a9a254dfada285b2368c653f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,9,167,59,125,216,151,36,169,162,84,223,173,162,133,178,54,140,101,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
