Pomme and Suzanne meet when Pomme helps Suzanne obtain an abortion after a third pregnancy which she cannot afford. They lose contact but meet again ten years later. Pomme has become an unconventional singer, Suzanne a serious community worker - despite the contrast they remain friends and share in the various dramas of each others' lives, in the process affirming their different female identities.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9476926dc8334741dd9648766778365ffd4eb89c","amp;dn":"L%5C%27Une.Chante.L%5C%27Autre.Pas.%281977%29.-.Agnes.Varda.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9476926dc8334741dd9648766778365ffd4eb89c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,118,146,109,200,51,71,65,221,150,72,118,103,120,54,95,253,78,184,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
