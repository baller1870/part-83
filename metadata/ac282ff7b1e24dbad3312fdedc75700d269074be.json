Leading by LON, as the one and\nonly song-writer and craftsman behind the entity,\nHELLVETO started with the intention of honouring\nproud and barbarian Slavonic ancestral heritage,\nsetting a solidified antichristian mission\nstatement, through their triumphant orchestral\nblack metal.\n\nThe new album Wiara, nadzieja..., potepienie,\n(which can be translated as Faith, hope...,\ndamnation) is by far the most complete, coherent\nand aggressive recording HELLVETO has done to\ndate, both musically and production-wise. The\nalbum was recorded and mixed at LS Studio with the\nband member himself handling all the production\nduties and performing all the instruments,\nincluding the entirely live drums.\n\nThe album is also the third and the final chapter\nin the three album saga, the Trilogy that\nstarted with the Od poudnia na pnoc CD in\n2008 and developed on Kry in 2009.Wiara,\nnadzieja..., potepienie contains all the elements\nthat can be find on the previous records, sewing\ntogether gloomy black metal with an epic and\nbeautiful orchestration. To summarize the Trilogy\nconcept theres a bonus CD added, entitled\nTrilogy which features extended and exclusive\nversions of musical themes known from the last\nthree albums. It will be a huge feast for the new\nfans as well as for those who have followed the\nband through the years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac282ff7b1e24dbad3312fdedc75700d269074be","amp;dn":"Hellveto-Wiara_Nadzieja_Potepienie-2CD-2010-BERC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac282ff7b1e24dbad3312fdedc75700d269074be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,40,47,247,177,226,77,186,211,49,47,222,220,117,112,13,38,144,116,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
