Guest stars abound on this album, and Kirkland's idiosyncratic guitar work is answered and abetted by appearances from Tab Benoit, Sonny Landreth, Kenny Neal, Cub Koda, Christine Ohlman and G.E. Smith, as well as driving work from drummer Jaimoe and organist Richard Bell. The material is all over the road, but particularly noteworthy as highlights are Kirkland's take on Elmore James' &quot;Done Somebody Wrong,&quot; &quot;Snake In the Grass,&quot; &quot;Nightgirl,&quot; and the title track. ~\n\nTracklist\n1.
