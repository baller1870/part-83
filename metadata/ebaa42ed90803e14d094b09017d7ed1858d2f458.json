Hopefully there will be many more. We know these kinds of discussions would never happen in the mainstream media, as they are basically the 4th branch of the United States Government. Please seed, share, and distribute to people you know (on DVDs if you have to) for Wikileaks could be the most important thing to happen in our lifetime. Thank you.\n\n\nkeywords: Wikileaks, Julian, Assange, wiki, leaks, pdfleaks, internet, freedom, security, government","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebaa42ed90803e14d094b09017d7ed1858d2f458","amp;dn":"PdF+Presents%3A+A+Symposium+on+Wikileaks+and+Internet+Freedom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebaa42ed90803e14d094b09017d7ed1858d2f458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,170,66,237,144,128,62,20,208,148,176,144,23,215,237,24,88,210,244,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
