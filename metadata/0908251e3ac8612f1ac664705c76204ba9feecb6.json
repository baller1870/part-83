The album was released on October 12, 2010. The album features mostly covers, and one original song, &quot;ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Not Christmas Without You&quot;. The album debuted at #11 on the Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart and sold 1,000 copies in its first week. As of December 8, 2010 the album has sold 14,000 copies.\n\nIn July 2010 McPhee began recording the album in Los Angeles. McPhee quoted\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ \tChristmas really is my favorite time of year,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt takes a little imagination to be recording right now but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t need a ton of Christmas lights in the studio to inspire me. I know these songs so well. These are the songs I listened to growing up. Hopefully my versions will be unique but at the same time timeless; full and rich yet simple and intimate. \tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThe title track was originally recorded by Billy Squier in 1981. It also contains many other traditional tracks, a medley of &quot;O Little Town of Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Away in a Manger&quot; and &quot;Who Would Imagine a King&quot;, which was recorded by Whitney Houston in 1996 for the soundtrack of &quot; The Preacher's Wife. Trumpeter Chris Botti accompanies McPhee on &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\n\nAllmusic stated: &quot;Arriving nine months after Katharine McPheeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2010 bleached-blonde AAA makeover Unbroken, Christmas Is the Time to Say I Love You finds McPhee going back to her roots, returning to her brunette locks and reviving the show-stopping theatrics that made her a star on American Idol. Christmas Is the Time is an old-fashioned holiday record through and through, from the reliance on standards to the soft, roomy arrangements that allow plenty of space for McPhee to hit her high notes, all without drawing too much attention to herself. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a setting well suited for McPheeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strengths, and song for song, this may be her strongest album: she does well by the standards, and the pop songs -- including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Not Christmas Without YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the title track originally sung by Billy Squier -- are good adult contemporary numbers. The album is simple and lean, not intent on making McPhee into a chart star, benefiting from a seasonal formula that allows her to simply sing like she did when she was on Idol.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0908251e3ac8612f1ac664705c76204ba9feecb6","amp;dn":"Katharine+McPhee+-+It%5C%27s+Not+Christmas+Without+You+%28mp4-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0908251e3ac8612f1ac664705c76204ba9feecb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,8,37,30,58,200,97,47,26,198,100,112,92,118,32,75,169,254,236,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
