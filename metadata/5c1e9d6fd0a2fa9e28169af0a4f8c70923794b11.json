After a job in Sweden ends more harshly than expected for this American abroad, Jack retreats to the Italian countryside. He relishes being away from death for a spell as he holes up in a small medieval town. While there, Jack takes an assignment to construct a weapon for a mysterious contact, Mathilde. Savoring the peaceful quietude he finds in the mountains of Abruzzo, Jack accepts the friendship of local priest Father Benedetto and pursues a torrid liaison with a beautiful woman, Clara. Jack and Clara's time together evolves into a romance, one seemingly free of danger. But by stepping out of the shadows, Jack may be tempting fate. \n\n\nEnjoy and seed please","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c1e9d6fd0a2fa9e28169af0a4f8c70923794b11","amp;dn":"The+American+DVD+SCREENER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c1e9d6fd0a2fa9e28169af0a4f8c70923794b11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,30,157,111,208,162,250,158,40,22,154,240,164,248,199,9,35,121,75,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
