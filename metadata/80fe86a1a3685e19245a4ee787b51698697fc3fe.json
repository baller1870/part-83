As Dalgliesh probes beneath the apparently unruffled calm of the clinic, he discovers that many an intrigue lies hidden behind the Georgian terrace's unassuming facade. Professionally, he has never known the taste of failure. Now, for the first time, he feels unsure of his own mastery as he battles to unmask a cool killer who is proving to be his intellectual equal, and who is poised to strike again.\n\nIn Cover Her Face, the first book in this distinguished series, Adam Dalgliesh plays second fiddle to an intricate plot. In A Mind to Murder, the book revolves around the questioning mind of A.D. and he begins to come to life as an interesting character. The plot isn't perhaps as intricate as in Cover Her Face, but the twists and turns are more entertainingly told. Even physicians have to follow the administrative rules. When the administrator of the Steen Psychiatric Clinic starts counting the patient numbers, watching the expense accounts and insisting on proper paperwork, even the physicians find themselves annoyed and wanting her gone. But no one wanted her dead. Or did they? The circumstances of the murder seem to point inside the clinic. The method of death is a particularly strange one, seemingly appropriate for a psychiatric clinic. The story has a certain anachronistic charm as it reflects practices and circumstances that have changed since 1963. The references to LSD as an analytic tool are particularly humorous in light of the drug's later uses (or misuses).(DM)\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80fe86a1a3685e19245a4ee787b51698697fc3fe","amp;dn":"A+Mind+to+Murder+-+P+D+James++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80fe86a1a3685e19245a4ee787b51698697fc3fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,254,134,161,163,104,94,25,36,90,78,231,135,181,22,152,105,127,195,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
