Almost two years later, People Like Us is sure to bring even greater success to country's &quot;hard-working,&quot; &quot;honest,&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; \n Tippin, the man who gave us the colossal hit, &quot;That's As Close As I&quot;ll Get to Loving You&quot; from 1995's Tool Box. Keeping traditional country alive with acoustic and steel guitars and fiddles, People Like Us breathes new life into a category of music that's been in a vegetative state. The 11 songs on this album are a welcome listen, including the animated &quot;Kiss This&quot; and &quot;The Best Love We Ever Made&quot; with Tippin's wife Thea providing sweet vocals on lead and harmony. Sounding &quot;too country&quot; sure hasn't killed this career. -- Maria Konicki Dinoia \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Kiss this [02:54] \n 02.And I love you [03:08] \n 03.People like us [03:23] \n 04.Always was [04:01] \n 05.I'd be afraid of losing you [03:36] \n 06.Lost [03:15] \n 07.Big boy toys [03:12] \n 08.Twenty-Nine and holding [03:42] \n 09.Every now and then [03:24] \n (I wish then was now) \n 10.The night shift [03:07] \n 11.The best love we ever made [03:57] \n (with thea tippin) \n ____ \n \n 37:39 min \n 54,6 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe766fca87aadb39c10c1ade68f2ac1a0a94692a","amp;dn":"Aaron_Tippin-People_Like_Us-%28Retail%29-2000-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe766fca87aadb39c10c1ade68f2ac1a0a94692a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,118,111,202,135,170,219,57,193,12,26,222,104,242,172,26,10,148,105,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
