Since most videos were recorded with a quality only suitable for TV broadcast, it is no use having a higher definition (even when encoded from a DVD).\nNone of the videos are live recordings (I don't see the point).\nMost musics are from the 80's and early 90's, with some more recent stuff.\nThe files are very small because I used the best codex around:\nvideo stream encoded with x264 with a crf (constant rate factor) of 27.\nThis means that all videos look as good, but the size of the file depends greatly on the complexity of the video to encode.\nAudio is in AAC at 44,1 kHz and 48 kb/s. Volume level has been normalized so that all videos sound as loud.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31270274c7dedcccb959712c41a6487cc93e894a","amp;dn":"416+music+videos+collection+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31270274c7dedcccb959712c41a6487cc93e894a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,39,2,116,199,222,220,204,185,89,113,44,65,166,72,124,201,62,137,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
