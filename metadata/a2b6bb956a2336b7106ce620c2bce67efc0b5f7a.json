The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2b6bb956a2336b7106ce620c2bce67efc0b5f7a","amp;dn":"E%3AShareOS2OSesIBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Red+-+8.162+-+English+-+D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2b6bb956a2336b7106ce620c2bce67efc0b5f7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,182,187,149,106,35,54,183,16,108,230,32,194,188,230,126,252,11,95,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
