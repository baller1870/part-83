Polls show that about a quarter of Americans believe in such paranormal nonsense.\n\nBut if any of that were true, you'd think the astrologers, or psychics, or ghost hunters would be eager to prove it, because, not only would they be proven right, they'd make a million dollars.\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s right, James Randi will pay them, or you, a million dollars. All you have to do is prove you have an ability that canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t be explained by science.\n\nMr Randi says it is simple. Make a claim about your ability, and his group will devise a way to test it. If you can do what you say, he will give you a million dollars.\n\nHe wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even test you himself. He says some people have complained that he gives off ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvibrationsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that mess up the test. So far no one has collected. In fact, no one has even passed a preliminary test.\n\nOn my show tonight James Randi will also demonstrate how some of these people, like the ones selling ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpowerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ bracelets that they claim can increase your balance or strengthÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ trick you into thinking their products work.\n\nHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll perform a test on me tonight, at 9pm on the Fox Business Network.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e171e5d101a1ec062ff17756cee5edd72fbec3db","amp;dn":"20101216-Stossel-%5BThe+Value+of+Skepticism%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e171e5d101a1ec062ff17756cee5edd72fbec3db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,113,229,209,1,161,236,6,47,241,119,86,206,229,237,215,47,190,195,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
