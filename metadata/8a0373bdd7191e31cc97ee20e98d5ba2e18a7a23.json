Travelling to the remote         \n     north-east of the Northern Territory, Costa meets with some of      \n     Australia's first inhabitants (and first gardeners), the Yolngu     \n   people.  He's been invited to the small community of Yirrkala, and    \n     in particular, the local school. The bilingual school has been      \n     given a grant for a new garden, but funds ran out before it was     \n    completed. Costa has offered his help and uses the school garden     \n    as a kickoff point to learn more about the local environment, the    \n     kinds of plants that grow in the climate and how the locals use     \n      the land around them. Along the way, he's introduced to bush       \n     tucker like native mangos, native peanuts and billygoat plums,      \n      which have 50 times the vitamin C content of oranges. He also      \n    tries his hand at hunting for fish and mud crabs and relaxes with    \n     a traditional bush massage.
