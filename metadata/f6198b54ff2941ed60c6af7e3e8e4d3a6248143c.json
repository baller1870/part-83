In 1980, these two musical titans got together and performed to a sold out crowd in New York City. George Harrison produced this 1980 tour film about that show. Tracks include such Sabbath classics as &quot;Iron Man,&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; and &quot;War Pigs&quot; (with Ronnie James Dio on vocals) and Blue Oyster Cult numbers such as &quot;Godzilla&quot; and &quot;Divine Wind.&quot;\n\nVideo:\nPAL 4:3 (720x576) VBR\nBitrate: 9.800 Mbps\nAudio:\nLinearPCM, 2 ch, 1536 Kbps\n\n\nTracks: 1.
