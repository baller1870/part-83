The picture is not too good (hard to make out facial expressions as the concert lights shine too bright on Meat Loaf) and occasionally  the video goes black because the camera is blocked by the head of a fan in front of the cameraman. \nThe audio is good but low. And the concert is complete! With a great set list and Meat Loaf has a great voice here. That makes it a very enjoyable show! Besides that it's a very rare show! So enjoy!\n\nPAL DVD\nRunning time: 141 minutes\nChapters: yes for each song\nSound: stereo\nCover: Included and created by me\n\nSetlist:\n01 Execution Day\n02 Blind Before I Stop\n03 Masculine\n04 Rock &amp; Roll Mercenaries\n05 You Took The Words\n06 Dead Ringer\n07 Burning Down\n08 Midnight at the Lost and Found\n09 All Revved Up\n10 Modern Girl\n11 Paradise\n12 Intros\n13 Two Out Of Three\n14 Bat Out Of Hell\n15 The Rock Medley\n\nScreen:\n\n\nCover:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69fea5a1b2aafdff8944534fb9daf83fa6cb3c3c","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+Sheffield+1987+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69fea5a1b2aafdff8944534fb9daf83fa6cb3c3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,254,165,161,178,170,253,255,137,68,83,79,185,218,248,63,166,203,60,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
