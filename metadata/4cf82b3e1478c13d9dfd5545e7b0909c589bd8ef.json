It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 21, 2010.[1] The episode follows anthropomorphic dog Brian after he publishes a self-help book, and it becomes an immediate success. Once he hires Stewie as his publicist, Brian soon becomes overly-egotistical, and becomes angered when he continues to botch his schedule, resulting in an embarassing appearance on the HBO series Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nThe episode was written by Gary Janetti and directed by Joseph Lee. The episode featured guest performances by Dana Gould, Arianna Huffington, Christine Lakin, Bill Maher, Katie Sah and Ashley Tisdale, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cf82b3e1478c13d9dfd5545e7b0909c589bd8ef","amp;dn":"Family+Guy+S09E06+brian+writes+a+bestseller+FULL+HDTV+720p+HD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cf82b3e1478c13d9dfd5545e7b0909c589bd8ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,248,43,62,20,120,193,61,157,253,85,69,231,176,144,156,88,155,216,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
