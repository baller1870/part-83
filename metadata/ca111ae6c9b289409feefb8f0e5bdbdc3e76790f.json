His previous album, 2004s 'Girl from Arkansas' was a more acoustic and laid back affair than we'd seen before, but 'Summerbirds' sees him find the perfect balance with a mix of guitar based rockier tracks and quieter pieces. The eleven songs are perfectly arranged by the small group of musicians; acoustic and electric guitars, bass, organ, accordion, percussion and violin form the musical backdrop - it may look simple, but the production by Picott and David Henry is excellent, and like his previous discs this album has an honest and natural feel. While often referred to as gritty and straightforward songwriter probably a remnant from his debut disc, it's a tag that fits a little less with each disc - over the course of his four albums, he's developed into a sophisticated and varied songwriter, and the range of songs here go from delicate acoustic ballads to guitar led rockier pieces. The two constants are Rod's strong vocals which fall into either style with ease, and his superb ear for a melody - there are some memorable tunes on show throughout. The album is a mixture of strong lyrics and pop-like melodies - 'Hand Me Down' and 'Trouble Girl' are the obvious highlights, and there's a great co-write with Slaid Cleaves in 'Sinner's Prayer'. Rod's consistency as a writer is remarkably high across all of his discs, and 'Summerbirds' is no exception - strong songs mixed with excellent musicians and memorable vocal performances.
