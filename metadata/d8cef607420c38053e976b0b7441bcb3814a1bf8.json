Instead, it's a neo-two-fer, containing ten songs written by Bacharach and David, and ten written by Goffin &amp; King. This, of course, contains some big hits and signature songs -- &quot;Wishin' and Hopin',&quot;\n&quot;Anyone Who Had a Heart,&quot; &quot;That Old Sweet Roll (Hi De Ho)&quot; -- but it's not really a compilation for the casual listener; it's for those who love Dusty and like to hear some of her best material in a different context. This context happens to make a lot of sense, and the end result is very enjoyable, but it may not be necessary for most listeners. \nStephen Thomas Erlewine - AMG\n\nDusty Springfield - Songbooks\nThis compilation 1997\n\n01  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - (They Long To Be) Close To You\n02  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - In The Land Of Make Believe\n03  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Another Night\n04  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Wishin' And Hopin'\n05  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Long After Tonight Is Over\n06  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - The Look Of Love\n07  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - This Girl's In Love With You\n08  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\n09  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Thenty-four Hours From Tulsa\n10  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Anyone Who Had A heart\n11  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Goin' Back\n12  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Will You Love Me Tomorrow?\n13  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - I Can't Make It Alone\n14  Dusty Springfield - Songbooks - Oh No!
