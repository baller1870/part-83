It is one of the most highly acclaimed anime series ever created and it is the highest rated anime series on IMDB.\n\nIts 26 episodes (&quot;sessions&quot;) comprise a complete storyline: set in 2071, the series follows the misadventures and tragedies of a group of bounty hunters, or &quot;cowboys&quot;, traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop.\nThe series' art direction centers around American music and counterculture, especially the beat and jazz movements of the 1940s-60s and the early rock era of the 1950s-70s, which the original soundtrack by Yoko Kanno and The Seatbelts recreates.[2]\n\nCowboy Bebop was a commercial success both in Japan and international markets, notably in the United States. After this reception, Sony Pictures released a feature film, Knockin' on Heaven's Door (2003), to theaters worldwide and followed up with an international DVD release. Two manga adaptations were serialized in Kadokawa Shoten's Asuka Fantasy DX.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19a4d1019fd3089e05a8512b8064900b4719d3ed","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Bebop+Part+One+1-18","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19a4d1019fd3089e05a8512b8064900b4719d3ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,164,209,1,159,211,8,158,5,168,81,43,128,100,144,11,71,25,211,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
