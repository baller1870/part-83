For some reason, that one quit working.\n\nThis torrent is a zip of 6-45 min and 2-30 min segments of Rev. Dake's &quot;The Jest of the Bible&quot; which was presented to the FGBMFI Convention in 1973.  Rev. Dake has passed away and this set of recordings are truly worth their weight in gold.  The two bonus recordings are Katherene Khuleman's last public presentation, prior to her passing and an early Oral Roberts doing his &quot;The 4th Man&quot; presentation where he illustrates the &quot;Jesus Thread&quot; thru every book of the Bible.\n\nIn Joy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31db7382c3367f8d876c0b009ea11c52f9a1b47b","amp;dn":"J.F.Dake%5C%27s+%5C%22The+Jest+of+the+Bible%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31db7382c3367f8d876c0b009ea11c52f9a1b47b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,219,115,130,195,54,127,141,135,108,11,0,158,161,28,82,249,161,180,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
