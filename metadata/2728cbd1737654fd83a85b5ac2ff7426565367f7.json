Together with his wife, Jasmijn, and their one year-old child, they are forced to move in with JasmijnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents in their flat in Antwerp on a temporary basisÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. The love between Martin and Jasmijn rapidly deteriorates. Martin seems to be living in a world of his own and refuses to lower himself into signing on at the employment office. He wanders through town and hangs round near the flat where they used to live. He finds a happy family there. Martin canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t accept that they have the happiness that he couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have and decides to destroy their happiness just like his happiness was destroyed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in his view. When Jasmijn finds out they arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t eligible for a new house because Martin never signed on at the employment office, it means the bombshellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been dropped. \n\nDirector\nMartijn Maria Smits\nScript\nMartijn Maria Smits\nCamera\nGregg Telussa\nSound\nHein Verhoeven\nSets\nSaskia De Wildt\nEditing\nMartijn Maria Smits\nMusic\nErnst Reijseger\nCast\nThomas Ryckewaert, Daphne Verhelst\nCast\nRon Cornet, Katelijne Damen","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2728cbd1737654fd83a85b5ac2ff7426565367f7","amp;dn":"Anvers+%28short+film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2728cbd1737654fd83a85b5ac2ff7426565367f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,40,203,209,115,118,84,253,131,168,91,90,194,255,116,38,86,83,103,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
