If you do not know what it exactly is, you would swear hearing a lost gem out of the deep past (late 60s/early 70s). Do not care about the singings - sounding like Ringo Starr trying to join a progressive rock band - just enjoy the music. Every style shown on the album is known already...but everything's appearing so self-evident and original as if the band members are escaped from a time-voyage right into our millenium.\nIt's no difficult album and will not only please some prog-weirdos. On the other hand it is interesting enough to deserve a few (if not many) listenings.\n\nmore infos and reviews at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=21184&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=21184&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b498c7ff63811648adfc0c2580de08d78630181","amp;dn":"DIAGONAL+-+2008+-+Diagonal+%28Vintage-Prog%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b498c7ff63811648adfc0c2580de08d78630181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,73,140,127,246,56,17,100,138,223,192,194,88,13,224,141,120,99,1,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
