However, after Limbaugh saves Brian from a violent street gang, Brian starts adopting Limbaughs political views and becomes a convinced Conservative Republican. Due to his newfound views, Brian clashes with his family and decides to move out, becoming Rush Limbaughs roommate. Limbaugh grows annoyed with Brian's enthusiasm, as Brian goes as far as travelling to Washington, D.C. intending to waterboard Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Ultimately, Limbaugh convinces Brian that in heart, he is still a Democrat and a liberal rather than a conservative Republican.\n\n\nPlease Seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c16959e21a47e82c8f503efb2c1c92db51d68189","amp;dn":"Family+Guy+-+S09E02+-+Excellence+in+Broadcasting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c16959e21a47e82c8f503efb2c1c92db51d68189","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,105,89,226,26,71,232,44,143,80,62,251,44,28,146,219,81,214,129,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
