The shy, well-behaved Nicholas appears to inhabit a happy, bourgeois family background, but in truth he is trapped in a nightmarish world where horrific thoughts distort his vision of reality.\n\nThere is a strong moral lesson here about the extent to which children are vulnerable to their parentsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and indeed societyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ view of the world. NicholasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ father is paranoid about what might happen to his son ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and, as it turns out, there is a good reason for his paranoia. So he smothers his son with affection and is overly protective - we never quite know how far this goes, but there is a strong hint that child abuse might be involved. The effect of this on Nicholas is devastating ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ basically his life is ruined. By knowing too much about the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s horrors, NicholasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ world becomes nothing but horror. This may not be a particularly original idea, but the film covers the territory with tremendous imagination and impact.\n\nAlthough it is a faithful adaptation of Emmanuel CarrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re best-selling novel, the film is a work of art in its own right. The strongest element of the film, without any question, is the photography. The visual imagery combines BuÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±uelesque surrealism with visceral horror, whilst maintaining a strong underlying theme and without undermining the strong characterisation. The bleak, snowy landscape in which the film is set provides an icy cold feel which somehow makes NicholasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ nightmares more frighteningly real and provide a bridge to his troubled sub-conscious thoughts.\n\nAlthough there is some pretty mild horror (twitching severed body parts in the remarkable &quot;MonkeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Paw&quot; sequence), there is nothing truly shocking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ although such imagery has a strong impact when placed beside pictures of a school trip. The shock comes more from the situation itself ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the fact that a young boy could have such a distorted vision of reality.\n\nClaude MillerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s direction is near-faultless, and he is served admirably from some talented child actors. Miller worked as a production assistant to such giants as Truffaut and CarnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, and that influence is felt in this film.\n\nThis is a film that is not only an excellent piece of French cinema, but one that has a strong message for our society concerning the susceptibility of children to corrupting influences. In a world where it has become the norm to regard children as young adults, this is a timely reminder which cannot be repeated too frequently.
