It has also been recorded by numerous other artists, including all-girl group Clout, Cherie Currie and Head East. The most famous version is this 1979 cover by Rainbow which became a UK top ten single. A house version of the song was released in 2006 by German trio Master Blaster, which has featured on several compilations. The song has often been misspelled as &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot;.\n\nBesides the pounding 'pub rock' delivery, the Rainbow version is famous for a grunt/groan from the lead singer, Graham Bonnet, followed by a key-change preceding the final reprise of the chorus. A bootleg version of this track in a country and western style is available from Blackmore's Night.\n\nThe Rainbow version was named the 82nd best hard rock song of all time by VH1.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Since_You_Been_Gone&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Since_You_Been_Gone&lt;/a&gt; \n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BABkPaadc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BABkPaadc&lt;/a&gt;  \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:02:59\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
