Confronting both his own limitations and the awesome power of nature\\'s uncontrollable elements, Peter risks his life to save his sister, Annie (Robin Tunney), and her summit team (Bill Paxton and Nicholas Lea) in a race against time.\n\nYears before, brother and sister were devastated by a horrific climbing accident. Peter made a split-second decision to cut their father\\'s rope to save his sister and himself. In the aftermath, Peter isolated himself as a nature photographer; Annie chased her father\\'s dream to climb the world\\'s highest peaks.\n\nNow, she is trapped in an icy grave at 26,000 feet - a death zone above the vertical limit of endurance where the human body cannot survive for long. Every second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of fellow climbers, including eccentric, reclusive mountain man Montgomery Wick (Scott Glenn), to ascend the chilling might of the world\\'s most feared peak to save her.\n\nRegion:NTSC\n   \nLanguage: Dolby Digital 5.1: English.
