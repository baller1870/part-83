A 63-year-old disabled veteran, Fuller had campaigned for Arizona Democrat Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in her reelection campaign and was at the supermarket in Tucson on Saturday to meet with her. He was shot in the knee and also wounded in the back. &quot;It looks like Palin, Beck, Sharron Angle and the rest got their first target,&quot; Fuller says. &quot;Their wish for Second Amendment activism has been fulfilled.&quot;\n\n\n- Why is Glenn Beck Obsessively Targeting Frances Fox Piven?\n\nFor more than a year, Fox News host Glenn Beck has been increasingly targeting Frances Fox Piven, a 78-year-old distinguished professor of political science and sociology at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. Beck has repeatedly accused her of advocating violence and of hatching a plan in 1966 to overthrow the system. Piven joins us in our studio.\n\n\n- Daniel Hernandez, Intern Who Helped Save Giffords: Political Discourse Has Become &quot;Completely Destructive&quot;\n\nWe speak with Daniel Hernandez, the 20-year-old intern for Rep. Gabrielle Giffords who has been credited with likely saving Giffords' life immediately after the shooting. &quot;I think a lot of people are realizing the political discourse has, for years, become completely destructive and more about tearing the other people apart instead of trying to work together to build up a nation and the state,&quot; Hernandez says.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3b4c1e62eaed6e0c4323dec5e929635a9ecc210","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+14+jan+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3b4c1e62eaed6e0c4323dec5e929635a9ecc210","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,180,193,230,46,174,214,224,196,50,61,236,94,146,150,53,169,236,194,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
