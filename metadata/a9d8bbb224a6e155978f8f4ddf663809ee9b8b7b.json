He has a loving wife, two adorable children and a owns a popular diner on the town's main street - he knows his customers and his customers know him right back. Joey Cusack is a notorious Mafia hitman, famed for having gouged out eyes with barbed wire, and noted for his bloody disappearance from Philly. Could they be the same person? Could Tom have an unknown past, concealed from his friends and family? A history of violence?\n\nTwo hardened criminals are on the run across the Midwest, leaving a trail of brutally murdered innocents behind them, however when they step into Tom Stall's diner, intending to rob it, he manages to disarm and execute both of the would be thieves. At first his family and community are amazed at this act of heroism, but when a scar-faced gangster (Ed Harris) arrives in town and starts to ask some probing questions about just how Tom was able to dispatch armed two thugs in the blink of an eye, things begin to turn a little sour. Tom's wife Edie (Maria Bello) is forced to face the unpleasant possibility that her husband may not be who he says he is, and, swimming through a mixture of conflicting emotions, is forced to make a decision of whether it matters or not?\n\nA History of Violence is probably Cronenberg's most accessible film to date, and also one of the best graphic novel adaptation's yet made - earning an Academy Award nomination for best adapted screenplay. The central premise - is Tom who he says he is? - maintains a sharp edge on the proceedings, keeping the viewer asking who they believe. A surprisingly good central performance from Viggo &quot;Aragorn&quot; Mortensen is bolstered by the excellent support of Maria Bello and Ed Harris - plus William Hurt's Oscar nominated cameo is quite, quite, brilliant.\n\nHistorically David Cronenberg has never shied away from controversy; films like Videodrome, Shivers, Naked Lunch and especially Crash managed to inflame large parts of the community; while A History of Violence doesn't quite reach the &quot;body-horror&quot; extremes that his other movies have visited, it's still a fairly unpleasant, but brilliant, movie.\n\nMost of the film was shot in Millbrook, Ontario, and the climactic scene was shot at the historic Eaton Hall Mansion, located in King City, Ontario, Canada.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\A History of Violence (2005)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\A History of Violence (2005)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].AVI\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.16 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 742 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nBit rate                         : 1 409 Kbps\nWidth                            : 712 pixels\nHeight                           : 462 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.179\nStream size                      : 964 MiB (81%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 1h 35mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 219 MiB (18%)\nAlignment                        : Split accross interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 407 ms\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.50.1.1100\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5518\n\n1/14/2011 3:57:21 AM\nmbam-log-2011-01-14 (03-57-21).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 23 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
