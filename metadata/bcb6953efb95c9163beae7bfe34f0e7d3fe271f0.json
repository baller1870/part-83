The wife and daughters take the Brady surname. Producer Schwartz wanted Carol to have been a divorcÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e but the network objected to this. A compromise was reached whereby no mention was made of the circumstances in which Carol's first marriage ended, but many assume she was widowed. The newly formed juvenile sextet, parents Carol and Mike, Mike's live-in housekeeper Alice (Ann B. Davis), and the boys' dog Tiger settle into a large, suburban home designed by Mike. The writers never specify the Bradys' specific location during the series, although there are numerous indications that show takes place in Southern California.
