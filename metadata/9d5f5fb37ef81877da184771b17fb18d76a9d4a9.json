Is it really hanging\nor maybe it's just downloading a large e-mail attachment? DU\nMeter provides the answer to these and other mysteries, and can\nalso alert you of dangerous or unexpected network activity\nWatching your data transfer rates can be very enlightening no\nmatter what you do online, and you'll soon be wondering how you\nmanaged without DU Meter before\n\nDU Meter for parents and business managers\nReceive alerts about dangerous or unexpected network activity\n\nIf you have teenage children or if you own or manage a small\nbusiness, you already know how hard it is to enforce certain\nrules for network usage, while respecting child's or employee's\nprivacy\n\nIf you install DU Meter on your child's or employee's computer\nyou can configure it to report back to you via email when monthly\nor weekly network traffic exceeds a certain threshold. DU Meter\nwill let you know if someone is breaking your rules (For example\nusing peer-to-peer software to share films and music). Since DU\nMeter 5, the software can even prevent any further Internet\nconnectivity once the alert condition has been met, without any\nuser intervention\n\nRemember, you are legally responsible for what your kids are\ndoing online. And while sharing music or videos may seem benign\nto them, copyright holding companies are suing peer-to-peer\nnetwork users for thousands of dollars for copyright violations\nDU Meter can alert you in time, so this kind of activity can be\nprevented\n\nIs your unlimited Internet really unlimited?\nProtect yourself from unexpected charges or Internet service\ndisruption\n\nMany Internet users believe their &quot;unlimited&quot; account lets them\nsurf the Internet, send large email attachments and download as\nmany movies and songs as they choose. However it is well\ndocumented by the media that many Internet Service Providers\nboth in the U.S. and elsewhere, do in fact set definite usage\nlimits, even though they may advertise to the contrary. Some will\ntake drastic measures like termination of an account without any\nadvance warning, if these limits are exceeded. DU Meter can\ncreate detailed reports of the total network traffic volume on\nyour computer and can alert you if certain limits are surpassed\nIf you have teenage children or if you own or manage a business\nDU Meter can be especially useful for you to you too\n\nDU Meter 5.0 new features:\n\nMost important features in DU Meter 5.0\nDU Meter can discriminate between Internet and local LAN\ntraffic, and monitor either of them. It can figure out what is\nInternet and what is LAN traffic automatically, or you can\nsupply a list of IP subnetworks you wish to monitor or ignore\nIf your networking traffic is not free (or it starts to cost\nyou over a certain monthly limit), DU Meter can calculate and\ndisplay total cost of traffic during this billing period\nPeak/off-peak rates are supported too\nDU Meter can terminate all network connections as a result of\nan alert condition being met. E.g. you can specify that if\nmonthly or daily traffic is over a certain limit, no more\nnetwork traffic will be initiated\nAlerts may be based on current monthly charges\nMany bug fixes and improvements in stability and robustness\nDU Meter can automatically recover now from database corruption\n(extremely rare)\nStill light system resources usage: Despite all these\nimprovements, DU Meter still takes very little system resources\n\nDisplay improvements\nExplorer deskband mode - DU Meter can attach itself to Windows\ntaskbar for unobtrusive and prominent display\nFull support for 64-bit Windows - including Sidebar and Windows\ntaskbar integration\nSeveral new types of graphs available, in addition to DU Meter\n&quot;classic&quot; mode\nNumerical display can show either current throughput values, or\ntotal monthly traffic, or monthly charges (network traffic\ncosts)\nSub-pixel anti-aliased drawing for more visually pleasing\ndisplay\nNumerical display is highlighted if alert condition is in\neffect\n&quot;Click-through&quot; mode - DU Meter window is visible and\nsemi-translucent, and all mouse clicks go to the application\nbelow\n\nReporting improvements\n\nReports network data transfer costs if configured\nReport file names can be automatically based on computer name\nor current date\nMany other improvements and bug fixes\n\nWhats New in v5.04:\n\nTaskbar band settings were not retained after a reboot - fixed\nStatistics collection driver optimizations to lower system\nresources consumption\nSeveral minor bug fixes and improvements\n\nFor More Info on DU Meter Visit: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hageltech.com/dumeter/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hageltech.com/dumeter/&lt;/a&gt;\nTE Release Filename: tedum504.zip\n\nINSTALLATION NOTES\n\nInstall DUMeter-Install.exe.
