Who?/Why?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nredump.org is a disc preservation database and internet community dedicated to\ncollecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever\nreleased on optical media of any system. This information consists of data\nchecksums and some additional characteristics of the physical medium. redump.org\nalso provides guides to ensure the backups used for checksum calculation are\ncorrectly done. Users of the website who follow the guides are encouraged to\nparticipate by sharing their results, contributing this way to the advancement\nof the project. Information from different people are compared to ensure the\naccuracy of the results and to identify alternate versions of the same game. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://redump.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://redump.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThey currently have more than 17700 (~5250 PS) disc entries present in their\ndatabase.\n\nBy submitting information about missing discs to the redump.org database, you\nwould be helping to achieve this greater common goal.\nIf you have original black CDs not listed in the PS database or even listed\nones, please go that extra mile and learn their preservation methods.\n\nTheir guides on how to backup discs properly can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Dumping-Guides&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Dumping-Guides&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you need more help, you can also visit redump.org's forum: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.redump.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.redump.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n!!!Content of this torrent is NOT provided by redump.org.!!!\n\nredump.org does not provide copyrighted material nor do they condone software\npiracy.

How to prepare?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe discs have been packed using PakkISO which works just like torrentzip.\nSimply put, PakkISO is the torrentzip of disc based games. It will create\nexact archives of matching files. It runs the data tracks through ECM, and\nthen compresses with 7z. Audio tracks are compressed using the Monkey Audio\nlossless format (.ape). This results in a much higher compression ratio\ncompared to torrentzip or standard archivers.\n\nYou can choose from several programs to use for decompression. They all are\nincluded in this torrent within 'important.zip'.\n\n1.1. PakkISO shell integration *RECOMMENDED* (PakkISO-0.4-setup.exe).[1]\n\nTo unpack a single game, right-click the game's folder and select 'UnpakkISO'.\n\nTo unpack a group of games, right-click the folder containing ALL game's\nfolders to be processed, and select 'UnpakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be\nautomated.\n\nTo pack a single game, right-click the game's folder and select 'PakkISO'.\n\nTo pack a group of games, right-click the folder containing ALL game's folders\nto be processed, and select 'PakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be automated.\n\n1.2. PakkISO (PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip).[1]\n\nTo unpack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into unpakkIso.exe.\n\nTo pack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into pakkIso.exe.\n\n1.3. redumpExtractor (redumpExtractor_exe.zip or redumpExtractor.zip).[2]\n\nSimple and intuitive GUI program. More information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thejbnet.com/progs/re/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thejbnet.com/progs/re/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAfter successful decompression you should have one cue sheet file (.cue) and one\nor several binary files (.bin).\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[1] Archives will be deleted after decompression; raw files after compression,\ni.e. content is transformed from compressed to decompressed state or vice versa.\nSo it is preferable to make a copy of directory you want to work with and use\nthat copy instead of source.\n[2] External programs needed for this application are available in\n'PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip'.\n\n\n2. How to play?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTo play on real hardware (console), first you need to burn the image(s) to a\ndisc using your favorite disc recording software and good quality blank media:\nload the '.cue' file and burn. Make sure your console is capable of playing\nbackups.[1] &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe best way to play the games included in this collection on emulators is by\nmounting them on a virtual drive (Daemon Tools/Alcohol). Once you have the disc\nmounted, just open the emulator and 'Open&gt;CD-ROM via SPTI...' (Xebra) or \n'Insert CD drive' (pSX). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://trial.alcohol-soft.com/en/downloadtrial.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://trial.alcohol-soft.com/en/downloadtrial.php&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://drhell.web.fc2.com/ps1/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://drhell.web.fc2.com/ps1/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[1] Please do not use Alcohol for recording, it is known to have problems with\ncue sheet parsing and therefore will produce incorrect copies (virtual drive\nfunction works fine though). Preferred programs are: ImgBurn *RECOMMENDED*,\nBlindWrite and CDRWIN.\n\n\n3. How to update?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncluded with torrent within 'important.zip' are several '.dat' files to verify\ndownloaded files, update from previous torrent or audit your collection. Use\nthem with RomCenter, clrmamepro or other similar ROM manager. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.romcenter.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.romcenter.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/&lt;/a&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNoes conserning this update:\n\nRules regarding PS backup creation slightly changed @redump.org. There are cases\nwhen the last sector of the data track ir erroneous (only container information,\nno actual embedded program data is affected and those last sectors are empty\nanyhow - it's a buffer zone). Previously such sectors were corrected but now\nthis erroneous structure will be left intact. This means that data tracks for a\nlot of CDs have changed. This is the last update provided in accordance with the\nold standard (nil). Included in directory 'patches' in 'important.zip' are\npatches to update your set to the new standard (ecc). To update copy patches to\nthe main directories that contain individual game sub-directories, i.e.:\n[redump.org] PSX (Japan) [#-E]\n[redump.org] PSX (Japan) [F-M]\netc.\nand run 'nil2ecc.bat' batch file.\nConversion of the whole set should take less than 30 minutes.\nAll following updates and full set uploads will be done in new standard.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c931be20df7fdeb240e495e370972448a60c9de","amp;dn":"%5Bredump.org%5D+PSX+%28Japan%29+2011+Spring+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c931be20df7fdeb240e495e370972448a60c9de","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,147,27,226,13,247,253,235,36,14,73,94,55,9,114,68,138,96,201,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
