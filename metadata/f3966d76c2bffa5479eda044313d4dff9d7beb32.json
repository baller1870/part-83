The site is a repository for information about freedom of speech, cryptography, spying, and surveillance. In February 2010, Cryptome was briefly shut down by Network Solutions for alleged DMCA violations after it posted a &quot;Microsoft legal spy manual.&quot; \n[1st half of hour 2]\n\nAlex also talks with University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Professor Donald Light, author of The Risks of Prescription Drugs. \n[2nd half of hour 2]\n\nThe second and third hours are an encore presentation. \n\n----------\nThough not announced on the web site, hour 3 of today's broadcast was a replay of a previously-aired conversation with Lord Christopher Monckton. \n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential \n to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a\n spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the &quot;big \n picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media \n for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to\n share information that counters the monotone of mainstream\n corporate media. \n\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information. Do not assume my support for or endorsement \n of the contents.\n\n Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: \n Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing \n until you've researched it yourself.\n \n !! please try some of the other shows I upload too !! \n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n..........\n\nfolder.jpg courtesy of commenter &quot;Nighted&quot; at the sebaygo1 blog\n..........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3966d76c2bffa5479eda044313d4dff9d7beb32","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+Show+-+2010+Dec+21+TU+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3966d76c2bffa5479eda044313d4dff9d7beb32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,150,109,118,194,191,250,84,121,237,160,68,49,61,77,255,157,123,235,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
