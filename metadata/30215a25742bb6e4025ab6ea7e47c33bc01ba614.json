These doctors not only changed the face of the NHS but also the culture of the communities they came to serve.\n\nThe programme reveals how these doctors came to Wales and, through their years of service, helped to change attitudes towards racism and immigration across Wales.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30215a25742bb6e4025ab6ea7e47c33bc01ba614","amp;dn":"The+Real+Indian+Doctors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30215a25742bb6e4025ab6ea7e47c33bc01ba614","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,33,90,37,116,43,182,228,2,90,182,234,126,71,195,59,192,27,166,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
