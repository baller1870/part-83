Sam Wexler is a struggling writer who's having a particularly bad day. When a young boy gets separated from his family on the subway, Sam makes the questionable decision to bring the child back to his apartment and thus begins a rewarding, yet complicated, friendship. Sam's life revolves around his friends-Annie, whose self-image keeps her from commitment; Charlie and Mary Catherine, a couple whose possible move to Los Angeles tests their relationship; and Mississippi, a cabaret singer who catches Sam's eye. (IMDB)\n\nThe movie won the &quot;Audience Award&quot; at 2010 Sundance Film Festival.\n\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed. Leechers remember, the community depends on you.
