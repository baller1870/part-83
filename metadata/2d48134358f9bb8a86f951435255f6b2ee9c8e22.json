A wiseass singer-songwriter with an agenda--the title comes from the CD\\'s opener, \\&quot;Last Time,\\&quot; and damns racist jokes while playing with a handful of epithets fast and loose like Lenny Bruce would--Reilly spits and howls like a less-focused Bern. Sometimes scattershot to the point of incomprehensibility, begging the question of whether anyone still finds the word commie funny--that\\'s Ike, brother. With a fairly hard-hitting band behind him, though, he can convince you that he truly believes that \\&quot;no limey ever made nothin\\' like \\'I Walk the Line.\\'\\&quot; You could call the best songs here shock value with a heart; when Reilly tips the balance for a rare feel-good moment (\\&quot;Put a Little Love in It\\&quot;), it\\'s hardly as affecting as when he mourns the death of a relationship as a \\&quot;God Damn Shame.\\&quot; Reilly\\'s artistry is still developing, but the best moments here arouse curiosity about just how good he might turn out to be.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d48134358f9bb8a86f951435255f6b2ee9c8e22","amp;dn":"Ike+Reilly-+Salesmen+and+Racists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d48134358f9bb8a86f951435255f6b2ee9c8e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,72,19,67,88,249,187,138,134,249,81,67,82,85,246,178,238,156,142,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
