Each song in this (small) collection has been ripped directly to .WAV (By me) from CDs, at 1411 KBPS, which is a much higher quality than those 320 MP3s.\n\nThis torrent contains 151 songs and I'll seed until this torrent reached 20 seeds (if it does).\n\nIn unrelated news, I'm also working on a 320 MP3 collection, which is, at the time this torrent was created, 12.3 GB. Expect that to come soon!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2d8099a2d5eb35852f2daad0bae5f55d79336f5","amp;dn":"Michael%5C%27s+Collection+of+WAV+Files+%281411+KBPS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2d8099a2d5eb35852f2daad0bae5f55d79336f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,216,9,154,45,94,179,88,82,242,218,173,11,174,95,85,215,147,54,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
