ABOUT\n\nredump.org is a disc preservation database and internet community dedicated to\ncollecting precise and accurate information about every video game ever\nreleased on optical media of any system. The goal is to make blueprints of the\ndata on console and PC game discs. Redump.org also provides guides to ensure\nthe dumps are correctly done. Users of the website who follow the guides\ncorrectly are encouraged to share their results to help build the database.\nMultiple dumps of games with the same serial number by different people are\ncollected to ensure the same results are gathered, which help correct any\nincorrect dumps in the database as well as to help recognize alternate\nversions of the same game. \n\nThey currently have more than 16500 (~5100 PSX) disc entries present in their\ndatabase.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://redump.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://redump.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy submitting information about missing discs to the redump.org database, you\nwould be helping to achieve this greater common goal. If you have original black\nCDs not listed in the PSX database or even listed ones, please go that extra\nmile and learn about their dumping methods.\n\nTheir guides on how to dump discs properly can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Dumping-Guides&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Dumping-Guides&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you need more help, you can also visit redump.org's forum: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.redump.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.redump.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nredump.org does not provide copyrighted material nor do they condone software\npiracy. Content of this torrent is not provided by redump.org. Please, no \ntorrent-talk on that site, only database and CD media related things or most\nlikely you will get banned.\n\n\n1. UNCOMPRESS\n\nThe discs have been packed using PakkISO which works just like torrentzip.\nSimply put, PakkISO is the torrentzip of disc based games. It will create\nexact archives of matching files. It runs the data tracks through ECM, and\nthen compresses with 7z. Audio tracks are compressed using the Monkey Audio\nlossless format (APE). This results in a much higher compression ratio\ncompared to torrentzip.\n\nYou can choose from several programs to use for decompression. They all are\nincluded in this torrent within 'important.zip'.\n\n1.1. PakkISO shell integration *RECOMMENDED* (PakkISO-0.4-setup.exe).[1]\n\nTo unpack a single game, right-click the game's folder and select 'UnpakkISO'.\n\nTo unpack a group of games, right-click the folder containing ALL game's\nfolders to be processed, and select 'UnpakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be\nautomated.\n\nTo pack a single game, right-click the game's folder and select 'PakkISO'.\n\nTo pack a group of games, right-click the folder containing ALL game's folders\nto be processed, and select 'PakkISO (Batch)'. The process will be automated.\n\n1.2. PakkISO (PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip).[1]\n\nTo unpack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into unpakkIso.exe.\n\nTo pack a game, simply drag and drop the game's folder into pakkIso.exe.\n\n1.3. redumpExtractor (redumpExtractor_exe.zip or redumpExtractor.zip).[2]\n\nSimple and intuitive GUI program. More information: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thejbnet.com/progs/re/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thejbnet.com/progs/re/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAfter successful decompression you should have one cue sheet file and one or\nseveral binary files.\n\n[1] Archives will be deleted after decompression; raw files after compression,\ni.e. content is transformed from compressed to decompressed state or vice versa.\nSo it is preferable to make a copy of directory you want to work with and use\nthat copy instead of source.\n[2] External programs needed for this application are available in\n'PakkISO-0.4-non-install.zip'.\n\n\n2. PLAY\n\nTo play on real hardware (console), first you need to burn the image(s) to a\ndisc. Using your favorite disc recording software and good quality blank media:\nload the '.cue' file and burn.[1] Make sure your console is capable of playing\nbackups.\n\nThe best way to play the games included in this collection on emulators is by\nmounting them on a virtual drive (Daemon Tools/Alcohol). Once you have the disc\nmounted, just open the emulator and 'Open&gt;CD-ROM via SPTI...' (Xebra) or \n'Insert CD drive' (pSX). &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.daemon-tools.cc/eng/products/dtLite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://drhell.web.fc2.com/ps1/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://drhell.web.fc2.com/ps1/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://psxemulator.gazaxian.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[1] Please do not use Alcohol for recording, it is known to have problems with\ncue sheet parsing and therefore will produce incorrect copies (virtual drive\nfunction works fine though). Prefered programs are: ImgBurn *RECOMMENDED*,\nBlindWrite, CDRWIN. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imgburn.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n3. AUDIT\n\nIncluded with torrent within 'important.zip' are several '.dat' files to verify\ndownloaded files, update from previous torrent or audit your collection. Use\nthem with 'RomCenter', 'clrmamepro' or other similar ROM managers. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.romcenter.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.romcenter.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:831c0890259f7424c1c0138744b9026919621d96","amp;dn":"%5Bredump.org%5D+PSX+%28Japan%29+2010+Winter+update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"831c0890259f7424c1c0138744b9026919621d96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,28,8,144,37,159,116,36,193,192,19,135,68,185,2,105,25,98,29,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
