Thewise men appear and begin to distribute gifts. The star moves further, sothey take it all back and move on. This is how Brian's life goes. The Jewsare looking for a release from the Romans, Spiritual and political decay,keep looking for signs and a group decides Brian is the Messiah. He cannotconvince them he is not. He joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, one ofseveral dozen separatist groups who actually do nothing, but really hatethe Romans. While not about Jesus, it is about those who hadn't time, orinterest to listen to his message. Many Political and Social comments.\n\n\nGraham Chapman, John Cleese and Michael Palin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a952e896f34ef1db0aca3085672c35b58faafe9","amp;dn":"Life+Of+Brian+%281979%29+DVDRip+NLT+Release+%28XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a952e896f34ef1db0aca3085672c35b58faafe9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,149,46,137,111,52,239,29,176,172,163,8,86,114,195,91,88,250,175,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
