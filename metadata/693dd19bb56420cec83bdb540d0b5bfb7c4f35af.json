He realizes that Mercedes has become popular since joining the cheerleading squad, and resolves to date her. Mercedes initially attempts to dissuade him, but after singing a duet of &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot;, she warms to him. Puck's former girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera) is jealous, and she and Mercedes sing &quot;The Boy Is Mine&quot;. When Mercedes realizes that Puck has returned to being a bully, she breaks up with him and resigns from the cheerleading squad.\n\nMeanwhile, Rachel (Lea Michele) realises that some glee club members are faking their singing. She tells Will (Matthew Morrison), complaining that she is doing most of the work, exhausting herself and getting ill in the process. She reveals the non-participants as Finn, Quinn, Puck, Brittany, and Santana. Will gathers the students and gives them a new task for the week - each Glee club member will have to do solos, and each must choose a song that best represents their feelings.\n\nRachel then confronts the non-participating glee members and insults them, leading her to sing Miley Cyrus's &quot;The Climb&quot;. But when she starts losing her voice, she goes to the doctor. Later, after an examination by Rachel's doctor reveals that she suffers from tonsillitis and may need to have her tonsils removed, she is afraid to have the surgery, fearing it will affect her voice and believing that her singing prowess is her only asset. Finn, who accompanies Rachel to her doctors appointment, tries to convince her that he loves everything about her and that there's more to her than her voice. He tells her that if she lost her ability to sing then Jesse would no longer find her attractive. Rachel tells Finn that she still cares about Jesse and that he needs to move on, prompting Finn to sing &quot;Jessie's Girl&quot; as Rachel's silhouette undresses. To put her fear into perspective, Finn introduces her to his friend Sean (Zack Weinstein), who was paralyzed from the upper chest down during a football game. At first, Rachel is nervous and overwhelmed by the meeting - but Finn forces her to stay as Sean tells her about his grueling experiences with his disability and how he realized that a person is not just one single thing. She then begins to understand why Finn brought her and thanks Sean as she leaves.\n\nIn the meantime, Kurt is jealous of the time his father Burt (Mike O'Malley) is spending with Finn, and attempts to emulate Burt's personality. He dresses in outdoorsman gear, sings John Mellencamp's &quot;Pink Houses&quot; during a glee club rehearsal, and attempts to have a fling with Brittany (Heather Morris), making out with her in his bedroom and ensuring that his father is aware of his new behavior. Frustrated that Burt is still spending time alone with Finn, Kurt reverts to his former personality and sings &quot;Rose's Turn&quot;. Burt overhears his performance, praises Kurt's singing and apologises for not spending enough time with him. He reassures Kurt that he still loves him, and always will, no matter what his son chooses to be.\n\nRachel eventually recovers her voice after taking the antibiotics her doctor prescribed. She goes back to Sean's house to thank him again, and offers to give him singing lessons. They start singing U2's &quot;One&quot;, and the image and music switch between her duet with Sean and the rest of the Glee club's own rendition of the song in a stage rehearsal. The episode ends with a tearful Rachel holding Sean's hand while they sing the last lines.\n\nI Will Be Uploading All Glee Episodes As Single Files Then All Together (:\nI Will Also Be Uploading All Albums To Each Season (:\n\nEnjoy (: &amp; Please Seed \n\nThanks\n\n- [Np]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:693dd19bb56420cec83bdb540d0b5bfb7c4f35af","amp;dn":"Glee+-+S01E18+-+Laryngitis+%5BNp%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"693dd19bb56420cec83bdb540d0b5bfb7c4f35af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,61,209,155,181,100,32,206,200,59,219,84,13,11,91,251,124,79,53,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
