The show continued the 1960s Beat-Club under a new name, and in turn was replaced by Extratour.\n\nA normal episode of Musikladen usually featured several live performances by guest musicians, and ran around 45 minutes. Some episodes were longer, and a few were shorter. In the 1980s, music videos were shown along with live performances.\n\n&quot;Such a Shame&quot; is a song written by Mark Hollis for the English band Talk Talk's second album It's My Life (1984).\n\nIt was released as the album's second single in 1984, and became a big hit in continental Europe in 1984 and 1985, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries, and becoming a number one in certain territories (their second number one single after the remixed version of their song &quot;Talk Talk&quot; which topped the South African charts in 1983); but strangely this single was largely ignored in the UK. In the U.S., the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. &quot;Such a shame&quot; was inspired by The Dice Man, which was one of lyricist Mark Hollis' favourite books. The song was also released in 2004.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Shame&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Shame&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikladen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musikladen&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAbgDaAdb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAbgDaAdb&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 5600kbps\n   Audio 3: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 384kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:54\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
