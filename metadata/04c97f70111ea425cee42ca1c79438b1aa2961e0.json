I hate it when they shrink a game by doing that.\n- NOT Greatest Hits Version, NOT PC Ultima Edition.\n- Original PSX Release.\n- 100% Complete.\n- Includes Brady Games Official Strategy Guide.\n\n\nFile Sizes After Decompression\n\nDisc One:\n712MB\n\nDisc Two:\n698MB\n\nDisc Three:\n629MB\n\nStrategy Guide:\n137MB\n_____________________________________________________\n\n\nThese are my backups from my original release of Final Fantasy VII.They are working and 100% complete. Ripped, compressed, tested, and uploaded by me. You wont find this torrent anywhere but here.\n\nI tested each disc using two methods. The first was epsxe 1.7.0. The second was the swap trick using a slim ps2 (backup burned at 4x). I didnt run into a single issue. All the discs worked great. If you have any questions at all, feel free to comment. And if you can, please seed. This is a wonderful game and needs to be shared with the world.\n\n\n**Read Me**\n\nFirst, extract the files.\n\nFor Epsxe:\n1)Click File\n2)Click run iso\n3)Select .img from the disc you want to play\n\nBurning:\n1)Pick a burning program (alcohol 120, imgburn, etc...)\n2)Insert blank disc\n3)Burn no faster than 4x\n\nYou can use the burnt game with epsxe (Run Cdrom) or a playstation. The playstation will need to be modded or use the swap trick. Check google for more specific instructions.\n\n\n~Sankou","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04c97f70111ea425cee42ca1c79438b1aa2961e0","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VII+PSX+Orignal+Game+and+Guide+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04c97f70111ea425cee42ca1c79438b1aa2961e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,201,127,112,17,30,164,37,206,228,44,161,199,148,56,177,170,41,97,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
