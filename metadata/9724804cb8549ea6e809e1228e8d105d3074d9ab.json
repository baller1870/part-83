The whistleblower behind the Pentagon Papers, Daniel Ellsberg, has called Mr. Manning a 'hero'. He is currently imprisoned in Kuwait. The Apache crew and those behind the cover up depicted in the video have yet to be charged. To assist Private Manning, please see bradleymanning.org.\n\n5th April 2010 10:44 EST WikiLeaks has released a classified US military video depicting the indiscriminate slaying of over a dozen people in the Iraqi suburb of New Baghdad -- including two Reuters news staff.\n\nReuters has been trying to obtain the video through the Freedom of Information Act, without success since the time of the attack. The video, shot from an Apache helicopter gun-sight, clearly shows the unprovoked slaying of a wounded Reuters employee and his rescuers. Two young children involved in the rescue were also seriously wounded.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9724804cb8549ea6e809e1228e8d105d3074d9ab","amp;dn":"Collateral+Murder+-+Wikileaks+-+Iraq+-+Full+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9724804cb8549ea6e809e1228e8d105d3074d9ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,36,128,76,184,84,158,166,232,9,225,34,142,141,16,93,48,116,217,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
