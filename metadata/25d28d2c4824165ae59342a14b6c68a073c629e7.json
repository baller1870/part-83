Everyone on the team is supportive but a bit upset with Lt. Laguerta for handing over the case that has affected one of their own. Det. Quinn however doesn\\'t feel Dexter is behaving like a grieving husband should and when Masuka mentions that Dexter was aware of Rita kissing her neighbor, he begins to suspect him. As for Dexter, he\\'s in something of a fog. He can\\'t grieve and even delays telling the children of their mother\\'s death until they return from the Keys with their grandparents. The FBI are keen to question him but he decides that the best course of action is to run off and disappear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25d28d2c4824165ae59342a14b6c68a073c629e7","amp;dn":"Dexter+Season+5+Episode+9+NL-Subs+by+Hollander","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25d28d2c4824165ae59342a14b6c68a073c629e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,210,141,44,72,36,22,90,229,147,66,161,75,108,104,160,115,198,41,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
