Gleason's easy-on-the-ears music is redolent of swank parties and conviviality--concepts that are as timeless as his renditions of such smooth favorites as &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.&quot; Unlike many name performers, he also stretches out a bit on this collection, extending the holiday vibe to a brace of wintry (but not specifically Christmas-tinged) tunes, including &quot;I've Got Your Love to Keep Me Warm.&quot; If you'd rather be sipping a martini than another cup of eggnog, this is the Christmas album for you.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nWith its soft-blanket strings and romantic bent, Gleason's orchestra was perfectly suited for Christmas music. His haunting arrangements make for some wonderful interpretations, especially the wistful baritone chorus of &quot;White Christmas&quot; and a dreamy reworking of &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town.&quot; One of the warmest holiday albums of all time. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8428e629dfd90dcd0d08e1840848d98b802ca029","amp;dn":"Jackie+Gleason+-+Merry+Christmas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8428e629dfd90dcd0d08e1840848d98b802ca029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,40,230,41,223,217,13,205,13,8,225,132,8,72,217,139,128,44,160,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
