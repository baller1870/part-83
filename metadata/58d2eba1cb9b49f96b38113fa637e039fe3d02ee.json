Immediately, he is picked on by another man, Fred, who seems determined to make his life misery. PierreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s unassuming and gentle nature compels him to suffer FredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s humiliating taunts and physical abuse, and he even tries to make a friend of his enemy. In the end, PierreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s will is crushed and he hits back. But by this stage, he has lost the support of his wife and the respect of his young son, VictorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\n\n\n\nFilm Review\nIf there is one category of film which French cinema has done well in recent years it is the social realist drama, and Trois huit is a particularly distinctive and memorable example of the genre. With a grimly uncompromising depiction of male relationships in a familiar working class setting, the film is both disturbing and harrowingly realistic. The apparent simplicity of Philippe Le GuayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s direction exposes the complexity of the relationship of the filmÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two principal protagonists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the near-psychopathic bully Fred and his seemingly willing victim Pierre. The nature of the relationship between the two men is both baffling and believable, with a curious dependency that could be mistaken for symbiosis. PierreÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lack of self-esteem makes him a willing punch-bag for FredÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pent-up aggression, implying there is something darkly masochistic in being a bullyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s victim; perhaps Pierre feels perversely gratified by the time and attention that Fred gives him, the next best thing to the love that is elsewhere absent from his life. As befits a good piece of social realism, the film boasts some fine cinematography and faultless naturalistic performances, including exceptional contributions from the two male leads, GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rald Laroche and Marc BarbÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58d2eba1cb9b49f96b38113fa637e039fe3d02ee","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+33%29+NIGHT+SHIFT+%282001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58d2eba1cb9b49f96b38113fa637e039fe3d02ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,210,235,161,203,155,73,249,107,56,17,63,166,55,224,57,254,61,2,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
