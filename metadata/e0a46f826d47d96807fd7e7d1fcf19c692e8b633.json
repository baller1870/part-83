Illustrating her analysis with hundreds of current advertising examples from mainstream and trade sources, Kilbourne presents a compelling argument that these cynical industries have a clear and deep understanding of the psychology of addiction -- an understanding they exploit to create and feed a life-threatening dependency on their products.\n\nDeadly Persuasion casts a critical eye on the corporate interests that lie behind the industries whose products kill more than 450,000 Americans each year.\n\nSections: The Advertising of Tobacco | The Advertising of Alcohol | Fighting Back | Extras: Features an Abridged version of the program ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0a46f826d47d96807fd7e7d1fcf19c692e8b633","amp;dn":"Deadly+Persuasion+by+Jean+Kilbourne+en%2C+de%2C+es+subtitles%2C+longve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0a46f826d47d96807fd7e7d1fcf19c692e8b633","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,164,111,130,109,71,217,104,7,253,126,125,31,207,25,198,146,232,182,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
