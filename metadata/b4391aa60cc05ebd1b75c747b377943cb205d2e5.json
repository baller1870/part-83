Here Voinitsky calls out of the fog of the past shadows of already gone people in order to understand where he made a mistake, at what moment his life got derailed and if there is a chance to make a clean copy of it. He even lapses into day-dreaming and starts thinking that they are real people. He shoots at Serebryakov who goes towards him with arms wide open.

He tries to embrace Elena Andreevna but she disregards him with the disgust of a ghost that is sick and tired of human spirit. At the finale the shadows get melted away in the fog, taking with them the medium himself. Sergei Makovetsky plays the part of Voinitsky. He is a grand actor, so when he comes on the stage you must be prepared for everything. But still, you become dumbfounded when you see how Voinitsky stiffens in the middle of the stage at the finale. Sonya by force opens his eyes and stretches a smile on his numb face. And he backs away and disappears in the past as well.\nOne of the main theatres of the country, the Vakhtangov Theatre, has been among outsiders recently, failing to find its director. The situation started changing when the Ministry of Culture RF invited the Lithuanian Rimas Tuminas to head the theatre. Over the last two years he has made several important premiers here but Uncle Vanya is the most amazing and unexpected production among them. On the one hand, TuminasÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s production seems to be assigned to demonstrate the traditions of the Vakhtangov School of ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“fantastic realismÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ that once used to be opposite to the MKhAT ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“school of emotionÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢. On the other hand, in the competition of the two schools Tuminas fights his rival with its own weapon ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Chekhov.\n\nElena Kovalskaya\n\n\nThis never grown-up but already aged child, ingenuous and naÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¯ve, every moment ready to be ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¹Ãƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å“punishedÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Uncle Vanya seems to argue with the last yearsÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ theatre tendency that is accusatory of the protagonist.

The pattern of his role is seemingly simple but it is actually difficult: only a very big actor can justify it, and Mr Makovetsky is precisely this. After the final monologue that was recited more like damnation rather than consolation Sonya makes out of her compliant uncle a mannequin with straddling arms, wide open eyes and an unnaturally stretched smile. Uncle Vanya spent his life with eyes wide-shut; he meets death - the darkness where he goes to can only mean that - with eyes wide-open.\n\nRoman Dolzhansky,\nKommersant,\n7 September 2009\n\n\nGenerally speaking, Tuminas made quite a simple thing. He presented all the characters of the play, from Serebryakov to Voinitsky without exception, as unlucky people overcoming their complexes (everyone does it in his/her own way). He uncovered and enlarged this hidden theme of ChekhovÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s play.
