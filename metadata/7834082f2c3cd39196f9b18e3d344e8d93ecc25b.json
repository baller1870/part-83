Nefarious backroom dealings? The secretive inner workings of the State Department? Or do these documents show that American diplomats might actually be good at their jobs? Fareed offers his take.\n\nAnd to help make sense of WikiLeaks, the financial crisis in Europe and its effect on America, we've assembled an all-star GPS panel. Niall Ferguson of Harvard, Richard Haass of the Council On Foreign Relations and Gillian Tett of the Financial Times.\n\nThen, 2010 was a catastrophic year.

What's it all about?\n\nNext up, someone Fareed calls &quot;one of the sharpest observers of American politics and life-in-general out there.&quot; Bill Maher, the host of HBO's &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot; and one of this county's most prominent stand-up comedians has had Fareed on his show before. Now see what happens when the tables are turned.\n\nAnd finally, a last look at when nationalism, is perhaps, out of fashion. \n\n-----\n\nNote:  This is an iPod video podcast that is available for free download from the website.
