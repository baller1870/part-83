Always quick to point\nout she &quot;doesn't make the rules&quot; when in fact she does when it\ncomes  to  her  library. Despite  the  chronic  vandalism, the\ndysfunctional staff and her own particular challenges with the\never-growing  Muslim   community,  Frances   wears  her   Head\nLibrarian's badge with relief.\nNo more so than during the head period leading up to Book Week\n- precisely the moment her life suddenly takes a turn for  the\nworse!\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nEpisode 3.01: Mother Of Pearl\n\nFrances is devastated when she learns that her mother,  Pearl,\nsuffering   from   both  dementia   and   a  really   horrible\npersonality, needs full time care. But to make matters  worse,\na  government  bureaucrat  Xavier  Fisher  rules  that  public\nlibraries are to turn a profit or face closure.\nWith a million dollars to raise, Frances appoints Dawn to head\nup  the  fundraising campaign.  But  getting the  rest  of the\nMiddleton Interactive  Learning Centre  staff motivated  isn't\neasy. Matthew is  pursuing a book  deal; Nada is  fighting off\nadvances from her ex-husband Hasan, Neil has a new  girlfriend\nJane, and Ky is busy planning his wedding day.\nOn the home front, Terry tells Frances he's reforming his  80s\ntribute band  Oils Ain't  Oils. If  that's not  enough to send\nFrances  over the  edge, she  learns that  her detestable  mum\nPearl  has run  up an  unimaginable debt  and ends  up on  the\nO'Brien's doorstep.\n\nRIP NOTES\n\nAC3 256 kbps is the only audio available\n\nEnjoy!\n\nGROUP INFORMATION\n9 Years of the Force and still\ngoing strong\n\nWhat we are looking for:\n* gigabit euro sites for x264 only\n* Fios x264 rippers or cappers\n* Internal 100mbit 1tb+ dump sites for Exlusive group usage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43d8abf745c6c05dac49dfef6f3865be96382cf2","amp;dn":"The.Librarians.S03.720p.BluRay.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43d8abf745c6c05dac49dfef6f3865be96382cf2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,216,171,247,69,198,192,93,172,73,223,239,111,56,101,190,150,56,44,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
