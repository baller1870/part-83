(Yes, it can be a pain to set these up to run properly so please don't complain... For-warned is for-warned !)\nAnyone who wants to update this package, please feel free to do so.\nI'll seed for as long as is reasonable... If you want more seeders, become one yourself. :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb9ad627f182e52e2525c298f3d6006ce8f1acb8","amp;dn":"Game+Console+Emulators+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb9ad627f182e52e2525c298f3d6006ce8f1acb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,154,214,39,241,130,229,46,37,37,194,152,243,214,0,108,232,241,172,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
