What would normally take days or weeks to build using traditional software development tools (C, C++, Java, Visual Basic) can now be created in record time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ by just about anyone. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perfect for making anything from AutoPlay CD/DVD/USB menus to full-featured interactive multimedia applications, complete with web interaction, database connectivity, video playback and much more.\nIf youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re looking for a faster, easier way to create software applications for the Microsoft Windows platform ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ congratulations! Your search is overÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nDrag and Drop Visual Software Development\nAutoPlay Media Studio flips software development upside down. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s visual and fast. You design first and then program later. You can build your first Windows application in less than 5 minutes.\nFrom images, text and music to video, drop-down lists and web content, you simply move things into place using your mouse. Then, you can add powerful interactivity with a built-in library of more than 865 easy to use actions. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be able to layout your graphic user interface as fast as you can drag and drop. The only limit is your imagination.\n\nEasy to Learn ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ No Programming Required\nYou donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to be a programmer, but with AutoPlay Media Studio youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll feel like one. Visual development makes programming easier for beginners and hardcore users alike.\nWhile a full scripting language is available for power users, the Quick Action wizard lets new users get up to speed right away. Just fill in the blanks to handle the most popular actions like opening documents, running programs, switching pages and more. AutoPlay Media Studio is easy enough for anyone to use.\n\n20+ Interactive Objects Add Instant &quot;Wow&quot;\nAutoPlay Media Studio 8 includes nearly two dozen built-in object types. The great thing about objects in AutoPlay Media Studio, is that they are already 'smart'. You simply drop them onto a page (or dialog) and then edit their 'properties' and 'events' to customize them however you want.\nChoose from buttons, videos, web/HTML, Flash, QuickTime, PDF, checkboxes, radio buttons, edit fields, rich text, slideshows, data grids, menu bars, tree controls and more. Plus you can easily add more thanks to 3rd party plugins.\n\nLua Scripting Language with 865+ Built-in Actions\nAutoPlay Media Studio isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just a pretty face. When you really need to get down to business, our Lua scripting engine is going to knock your socks off. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s very powerful, yet very easy to use. The Action Wizard can even write the code for you!\nBut we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stop there. We spent years adding in over 865+ high-level functions. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s code you can use but donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have to write. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s everything from XML parsing and SQL database queries to web server script interaction, file transfers and much more.\n\nExpandable with Modules, Plugins and Addons\nPlugins are one of the best features of AutoPlay Media Studio. They allow 3rd party software developers to extend and expand the product in an extremely integrated and seamless fashion.\nPlus, with new Lua 5.1 module compatibility, you have access to a wealth of free code you can download and use in your projects. Just some of the useful modules out there include Bit Operation, Date, Canvas Draw, Imaging Tool, GD, Crypto, Colors, Speech, Alien, Social (Twitter), CURL and Regular Expression Parsing.\n\nNot Just Dependable: Battle Hardened\nDependable software doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happen overnight. AutoPlay Media Studio was originally released on October 8, 1997 (then called AutoPlay Menu Studio), and weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been improving it ever since.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been the industry standard tool for creating autoplay/autorun CD, DVDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and USB drive menus for years. Heck, we invented the category! Over time, it became the secret ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“visual programmingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ weapon for thousands of savvy software developers, consultants and IT professionals.
