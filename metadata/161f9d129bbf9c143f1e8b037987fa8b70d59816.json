One is a pervert, and ironically the other is a highly sought after female student. Koyuki's boring life is changed when he saves an odd-looking dog, named Beck, from some kids. Beck's owner turns out to be an emerging rock musician, RyÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â«suke Minami, who soon influences Koyuki to start playing the guitar, and even gives one to him. The story focuses on the trials and tribulations of their rock band named BECK, and Koyuki's relationships with the members of the band, in particular RyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â»suke Minami and his sister, Maho Minami.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:161f9d129bbf9c143f1e8b037987fa8b70d59816","amp;dn":"BECK+-+Mongolian+Chop+Squad+01-26+DVDrip+ENG+JAP+Dual+OST+Manga+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"161f9d129bbf9c143f1e8b037987fa8b70d59816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,31,157,18,155,191,156,20,63,30,139,3,121,135,250,139,112,213,152,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
