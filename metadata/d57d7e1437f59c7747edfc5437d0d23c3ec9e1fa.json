These files can be in any format, as long as they use Mastersplitter's naming convention (.001 - .999). \n\nAJoiner has several useful options for cancelling join operations if files are missing, automatically deleting segment files, and automatically launching joined files. AJoiner can also use pre-specified join locations, or just join to the same location as the original segments.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d57d7e1437f59c7747edfc5437d0d23c3ec9e1fa","amp;dn":"AJoiner+%28001+file+Joiner%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d57d7e1437f59c7747edfc5437d0d23c3ec9e1fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,125,126,20,55,245,156,119,71,237,252,84,55,208,210,60,62,201,225,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
