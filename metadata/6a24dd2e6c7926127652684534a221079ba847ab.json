She combines all aspects of her musical upraising -- from folk to jazz. Jenn doesn't use picks, she uses her fingers -- &quot;giving a warmer, softer tone&quot; -- and one I find to be a bit deeper, more meaningful in its sound. It is obvious she has a deep and abiding love for music, it carries across to the listener in every note, every nuance. This is great music!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/08/jenn-adams/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/08/jenn-adams/&lt;/a&gt;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a24dd2e6c7926127652684534a221079ba847ab","amp;dn":"Jenn+Adams...Water%281997%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a24dd2e6c7926127652684534a221079ba847ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,36,221,46,108,121,38,18,118,82,104,69,52,162,33,7,155,168,71,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
