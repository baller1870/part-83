This is caused by the chunk not being prepared when the entity is added. The servers SHOULD tell the client what chunks to render before adding entities. Then I remembered the throttling which makes entity updates higher priority than chunk updates..\n\nSo now whenever the server tells the client to add an entity, it gets added to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œreinsert if ever lostÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½-list I already have in place, but which was only used for a few special entities (mainly the local player) so far.\n\nThe client has been updated to 1.2.3_04 (hey look at that!), and the server has an optional update to 0.2.5_02.\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve got plenty of more bugs to address in SMP, which will be fixed over the coming weeks. I think we might be getting close to beta soon. =D\n\n(btw, working in an office with real people is AWESOME. I love it)\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned for updates @ Kaen-Paradise.co.cc\n\n=======================================================\n\nThis is an UPGRADE ONLY RELEASE\n\nREPLACE YOUR BIN FOLDER IN &quot;.minecraft/bin&quot; with this bin folder\nOverwrite all files.
