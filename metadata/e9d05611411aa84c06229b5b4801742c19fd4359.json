This new record is a particularly hot performance from the summer '91 shows, and features Donald Ross Skinner and Rooster Cosby at their best. Head Heritage is currently the sole distributor of this Revell Records release (and will continue to be if everything goes to plan), so check out this concert album by an artist who has all-too-infrequently been caught live on record.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9d05611411aa84c06229b5b4801742c19fd4359","amp;dn":"Julian+Cope+-+Live+Japan+%5C%2791","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9d05611411aa84c06229b5b4801742c19fd4359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,208,86,17,65,26,168,76,6,34,155,91,72,1,116,44,25,253,67,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
