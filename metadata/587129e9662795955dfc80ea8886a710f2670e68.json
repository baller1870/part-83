She has sad news of his old friend, her other ex-husband, Marty Hewitson. Marty is dying, but needs one last favour done for him - now, today, at once. Eusden reluctantly agrees. But what should be a simple errand soon it turns into a race for life - his and Marty's. It takes him across Belgium, Germany and Denmark and on into the Nordic heart of a mystery that somehow connects Marty's long dead grandfather, Clem Hewitson, an Isle of Wight police officer, with the tragic fate of the Russian Royal Family, murdered ninety years earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:587129e9662795955dfc80ea8886a710f2670e68","amp;dn":"Found+Wanting+-+Robert+Goddard++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"587129e9662795955dfc80ea8886a710f2670e68","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,113,41,233,102,39,149,149,93,252,128,234,136,134,167,16,242,103,14,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
