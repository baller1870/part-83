Should he and his seat of power, the Holy See, continue to enjoy an immunity that places them above the law?\n\nGeoffrey Robertson QC, a distinguished human rights lawyer and judge, evinces a deep respect for the good works of Catholics and their church. But, he argues, unless Pope Benedict XVI can divest himself of the beguilements of statehood and devotion to obsolescent canon law, the Vatican will remain a serious enemy to the advance of human rights.\n\nGeoffrey Robertson QC is founder and head of Doughty Street Chambers. He is a 'distinguished jurist' member of the United Nations Justice Council, having served as the first President of the Special Court in Sierra Leone. He has argued many landmark cases in media, constitutional and criminal law in the European Court of Human Rights, the House of Lords, the Privy Council and Commonwealth courts. He has recently appeared in the Court of Final Appeal for Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of Malaysia, the Fiji Court of Appeal, the High Court of Australia and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the World Bank's International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\nHis books include Crimes Against Humanity: The Struggle for Global Justice; Media Law; Freedom, the Individual and the Law; a memoir The Justice Game; and The Tyrannicide Brief, which tells the dramatic story of how Cromwell's lawyers challenged the monarchy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9cfa00b75c11bf10010a1fe6ef851b0d6e0852","amp;dn":"The+Case+of+the+Pope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9cfa00b75c11bf10010a1fe6ef851b0d6e0852","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,156,250,0,183,92,17,191,16,1,10,31,230,239,133,27,13,110,8,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
