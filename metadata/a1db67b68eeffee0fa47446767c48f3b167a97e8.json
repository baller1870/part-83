When Shushan suffers a heart attack, his life is saved by the Centre's mentally handicapped janitor, James Jones (Matthew Fox)--and in the ensuing weeks, doctor and patient become closer than any father and son could ever be. Partly out of gratitude, Shushan makes it his mission to locate James' long-estranged biological father. And as a result of his relationship with James Jones, Shushan finally realizes how he has long short-changed his own family, especially his son Brian (Bradley Whitford), whom Shushan has unfairly written off as a failure. The real James Jones makes an appearance at the end of Behind the Mask, which first aired February 28, 1999 on CBS.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a1db67b68eeffee0fa47446767c48f3b167a97e8","amp;dn":"Behind+The+Mask%281999%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a1db67b68eeffee0fa47446767c48f3b167a97e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,219,103,182,142,239,254,224,250,71,68,103,103,196,143,59,22,122,151,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
