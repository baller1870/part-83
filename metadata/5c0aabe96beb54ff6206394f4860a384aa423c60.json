The pair has created a sound that's somewhat fuller and more textured than either that debut CD or its follow up EP, Cerro Verde, from 2006. Even with the addition of keyboards and various percussion elements, Miller's Lone Start State twang still takes center stage, as exemplified on songs like &quot;Went Walking&quot; and &quot;Train Song.&quot; This time around, the vocals are also more of a group project with Miller's sister Gina Milligan and guitarist Jeremy Buller both offering harmonies. Vocals are emphasizes so much that there's an a cappella song, &quot;On and Off,&quot; that's sectioned out into three parts.\n\ncd ripped bydBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/23/bosque-brown/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/23/bosque-brown/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c0aabe96beb54ff6206394f4860a384aa423c60","amp;dn":"Bosque+Brown...Baby%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c0aabe96beb54ff6206394f4860a384aa423c60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,10,171,233,107,235,84,255,98,6,57,79,72,96,163,132,170,66,60,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
