Wisely choosing to work with country vets Vince Gill and Clint Black, pop crooner Kenny Loggins, and the London Symphony Orchestra, Newton-John creates a companion her 2001 holiday tour. Piecing together an album in patchwork-quilt fashion, she stitches four tunes sung on Loggins's 1999 TNN television special and borrows six other traditional songs from a limited-release Hallmark album she made in 2000. Newton-John adds her own forgettable &quot;Christmas Never Felt Like This Before&quot; and an unreleased version of &quot;The First Noel.&quot; While the orchestral arrangements are soaring and the country flourishes convincing, Newton-John's collection is best suited to fans.\n\nAllmusic Review: \nOlivia Newton-John's The Christmas Collection finds the singer in fine voice as she interprets some of the season's classic songs, as well as some original material, in a slightly countrified setting. Together with the London Symphony Orchestra, Kenny Loggins, Clint Black, and Vince Gill, Newton-John delivers gently festive versions of &quot;The First Noel,&quot; &quot;Silver Bells,&quot; &quot;White Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Silent Night,&quot; among others. While the original song, &quot;Christmas Never Felt Like This Before,&quot; is nothing special, Christmas Collection is still a pleasant-enough holiday album, particularly for Newton-John fans. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e90220a08c4492327ac07132951c14ce9df4b227","amp;dn":"Olivia+Newton-John+-+The+Christmas+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e90220a08c4492327ac07132951c14ce9df4b227","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,2,32,160,140,68,146,50,122,192,113,50,149,28,20,206,157,244,178,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
