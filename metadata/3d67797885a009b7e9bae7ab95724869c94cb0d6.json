In an elegant and original film he finds that waves\n      are not made of water, that some waves travel sideways and that\n      the sound of the ocean comes not from water but from bubbles.\n      Waves are not only beautiful but also profoundly important, and\n      there is a surprising connection between the life cycle of waves\n      and the life of human beings.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
