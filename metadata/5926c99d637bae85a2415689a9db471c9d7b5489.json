He began his recording career as vocalist with the Three Chuckles, charting with 'Runaround' in 1954, before going solo three years later. In the early years of rock, he co-starred in revues staged by legendary disc jockey Alan Freed, appearing with such artists as Chuck Berry and LaVern Baker. Randazzo also had starring roles in such rock films as &quot;Hey, Let's Twist&quot;, &quot;The Girl Can't Help It&quot;, &quot;Mr. Rock &amp; Roll and Rock&quot;, &quot;Rock, Rock&quot;. In the 'teen idol' era, Randazzo hit the charts with 'Little Serenade', 'The Way Of A Clown' and 'Big Wild World'. \nHe penned many songs for Little Anthony and the Imperials, producing and arranging several albums for the group in the mid-60s. The hit songs included &quot;Goin' Out of My Head&quot; (#6 Pop, #22 R&amp;B), which was covered by numerous artists including The Zombies and Frank Sinatra; &quot;Hurt So Bad&quot; (#10 Pop, #3 R&amp;B), which was covered by The Lettermen (#12 in 1969), as well as Linda Ronstadt who took it to #8 in 1980; and the Imperials' Top 20 hits, &quot;I'm On The Outside (Looking In)&quot; and &quot;Take Me Back&quot;. The Lettermen combined &quot;Goin' Out of My Head&quot; with Frankie Valli's hit, &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You&quot; in a medley which reached #7 in 1968. Teddy Randazzo and his writing partner, Bobby Weinstein, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2007.Randazzo died in his sleep at age 68, at his home in Orlando, Florida. \n        Connie Francis is an American pop singer, and the top-charting female vocalist of the 1950s and 1960s. She is best known for her downbeat ballads delivered in her trademark sobbing, emotive style. In addition to her signature song, &quot;Who's Sorry Now?&quot;, her many hits include &quot;Lipstick on Your Collar&quot;, &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;, and &quot;Stupid Cupid&quot;. She topped the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart on three occasions with &quot;Everybody's Somebody's Fool&quot;, &quot;My Heart Has a Mind of Its Own&quot; and &quot;Don't Break the Heart That Loves You&quot;. She also was known for her early relationship with the singer and teen heart-throb Bobby Darin.\n       Paul Carr was an character actor who was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. As a teenager, he had an interest in music as well as acting. After a short stint in the United States Marine Corps during his late teens, his acting career began with a role in a New Orleans production of Billy Budd. By the mid-1950s, he was working on live television in New York City, including appearances on the popular Studio One and Kraft Television Theater. His film career continued with a much larger role in Alfred Werker's &quot;The Young Don't Cry&quot; in 1957 starring James Whitmore and Sal Mineo; and that same year he appeared in the Warner Bros. rock and roll jukebox movie &quot;Jamboree&quot; as Pete Porter.  &quot;Who Are We To Say.&quot; is a love song for tween from movie &quot;Jamboree&quot;. Actress Freda Holloway is lipsyncing the voice of Connie Francis. Later &quot;Who Are We to Say&quot; was released as a single, but alas Carr's duet side is not with Connie Francis on the record. In all likelihood Connie's recording contract elsewhere prohibited the release, so her part on vinyl is by Fran Lori.\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n06.  THE FIFTIES\n\n\n     The 1950s offered a combination of sounds for everyone. Rock 'n roll, rhythm and blues, love songs, jazz (first Newport Festival), calypso (Harry Belafonte), and musicals were all popular. Records rather than air play began to determine the popularity of a song.  Hit makers were Johnny Ray, Patti Page, Nat King Cole, Teresa Brewer,Tony Bennett, Perry Como,  Pat Boone, Doris Day, Eddie Fisher, Frankie Laine, Dean Martin , and Peggy Lee. Groups were popular, including the Platters, Les Paul and Mary Ford, Ames Brothers , Four Aces, Buddy Holly and many others made the huge number of decade hits.In 1956, Elvis became the first rock star. Black recording artists Chuck Berry and Fats Domino became rock 'n roll stars. Color TV became a major influence, stereos were offered for sale, the first Grammy (1959) was given.  \n\n\n06.01. &quot;FEEL GOODÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ TUNES OF THE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES \n\n        Light melodies, sweet lyrics, wholesome singers. Innocent and inoffensive songs. All of this can be said about the music of the Early Fifties. Most of the songs of the Early Fifties were &quot;feel-good&quot; tunes, which genuinely reflected the mood of post World War II America. Artists like Pat Boone , Rosemary Clooney, Dean Martin  and Perry Como  dominated pop charts.\n\n\n         PEGGY LEE &amp; DAVE BARBOUR - I COVER THE WATERFRONT  (1950)\n         PATTI PAGE  -  TENNESSEE WALTZ  (1950)\n         GENE KELLY  -   SINGINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ IN THE RAIN  (1952)\n         EDDIE FISHER  - DOWNHEARTED   (1952)\n         PERRY COMO &amp; FONTANE SISTERS  - SILVER AND GOLD   (1952)\n         DEAN MARTIN - THAT'S AMORE   (1953)\n         ROSEMARY CLOONEY  - MAMBO ITALIANO  (1954) \n         PEGGY LEE  -  JOHNNY GUITAR  (1955)  \n         DINAH SHORE  - HONEYSUCKLE  ROSE  (1956)\n         PATTI PAGE  - CHANGING PARTNERS   (1956)\n         DEAN MARTIN - MEMORIES ARE MADE OF THIS   (1956)\n         MARIO LANZA &amp; LUISA DI MEO   -   ARRIVEDERCI ROMA  (1958) \n         DOMENICO MODUGNO ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ VOLARE  (1958)\n         LOUIS PRIMA  - BUONA SERA SIGNORINA   (1958)\n         DEAN MARTIN  -  MAMBO ITALIANO \n         DEAN MARTIN  -  Medley : VOLARE &amp; EVENING IN ROMA   \n         PEGGY LEE &amp; FRANK SINATRA - NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT   (1962)\n         DEAN MARTIN  -  EVERYBODY LOVES SOMEBODY  (1964)\n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06.02   POP MUSIC  (1955 -1959) \n       \n          In the South, where Country and Western had ruled the charts, Sam Phillips opened the Memphis Recording Service - the first place a black musician could go to record. His motto, &quot;We Record Anything, Anywhere, Anytime.&quot; During the summer of 1953, Elvis Presley came to the Memphis Recording Service to make a record, ostensibly for his mother's birthday, but with hope of being discovered.

ROCK AND ROLL &amp; ROCKABILLY \n\n        In Chicago, two brothers, Phil and Leonard Chess  took the best of the black bluesmen performing in their nightclub and began recording them on their Chess label. Chess Records, a storefront on Cottage Avenue in the &quot;Little Mississippi&quot; area of Chicago, was already home to the great Muddy Waters. About this time, a Cleveland DJ named Alan Freed  began playing Black R&amp;B tunes. Freed moved his show to New York in 1954 and began including live performances, especially of the artists with the vocal harmonies he favored. His called this sound Rock and Roll. Fittingly, he is the first Rock DJ. And many consider his Moondog Coronation Ball, held March 21st, 1952 in Cleveland, to be the very birthdate of Rock and Roll.\n\n          Rock and roll  is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Its roots lay mainly in blues, rhythm and blues, country, folk, gospel, and jazz. The style subsequently spread to the rest of the world and developed further, leading ultimately to modern rock music. \n\n          Rockabilly is one of the earliest styles of rock and roll music, and emerged in the early 1950s. The term rockabilly is a portmanteau of rock and hillbilly, the latter a reference to the country music (often called hillbilly music in the 1940s and 1950s) that contributed strongly to the style's development. Other important influences on rockabilly include western swing, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues. Many  popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino, Chuck Berry and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as &quot;rockabilly&quot;.\n          Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Roy Orbison, Sam Cooke, The Coasters, Carl Perkins, Buddy Holly, Billy Haley &amp; The Comets, The Everly Brothers, Rickie Nelson, Little Richard, LaVern Baker .............\n\n\n\n         BILL HAYLEY &amp; HIS COMETS  -  ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK  (1954)\n         CHUCK BERRY -  MAYBELLENE (1955)\n         BO DIDDLEY - BO DIDDLEY  (1955)\n         GENE VINCENT  -  BE-BOP-A-LULA  (1956)\n         LITTLE RICHARD  -  LONG TALL SALLY   (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY - HEARTBREAK HOTEL (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY - HOUND DOG  (1956) \n         EDDIE COCHRAN  -  TWENTY FLIGHT ROCK  (1956)\n         ELVIS PRESLEY   -   JAILHOUSE ROCK  (1957)   \n         ELVIS PRESLEY  - TOO MUCH  (1957)\n         BUDDY HOLLY &amp; THE CRICKETS  -  PEGGY SUE  (1957)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  OH BABY DOLL   (1957)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  YOU CANÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢T CATCH ME  (1957)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  MEMPHIS , TENNESSEE  (1957)\n         LITTLE RICHARD  - LUCILLE   (1957) \n         GENE VINCENT  -  BE ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“BOP -A-LULA   (1958)\n         GENE VINCENT  - ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN   (1958)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN -  SUMMERTIME BLUES  (1958)\n         EDDIE COCHRAN - C'MON EVERYBODY   (1958)\n         JERRY LEE LEWIS  -  BREATHLESS  (1958)\n         CARL PERKINS  -  GLAD ALL OVER  (1958)\n         DANNY  &amp; THE JUNIORS  - ROCK  &amp; ROLL IS HERE TO STAY   (1958)\n         DUANNE EDDY -  REBEL ROUSER  (1958)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  JOHNNY B.GOODE  (1958) \n         \n\n\n\n        06.04  ROCKABILLY  REVIVAL \n\n        Rockabilly Revival early 1970s  (return to the simple, loud, fast, emotionally-direct music of early rock and roll). Some musicians stripped their sound down to three chords, loud guitars, and shouted lyrics, creating early punk rock. Other musicians turned back to the original rock and roll music of the 1950s for inspiration, and in the late 1970s, an underground rockabilly revival began to emerge.  \n\n\n\n         \n         BO DIDDLEY  -  HEY BO DIDDLEY   (1969)\n         THE HOUSESHAKERS  -  BE-BOP-A-LULA (1972)\n         HEINZ BURT  -  C'MON EVERYBODY  (1972)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  ROAD RUNNER   (1972)\n         BILL HAYLEY &amp; HIS COMETS  - ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK  (1972) \n         LITTLE RICHARD - LUCILLE  (1972) \n         BO DIDDLEY  -  BO DIDDLEY   (1985)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  BO PUT THE ROCK IN ROCK &amp; ROLL  (1985)\n         BO DIDDLEY  -  GUNSLINGER  (1985)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  BIO  (1986)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  CAROL  (1987)\n         CHUCK BERRY  -  ROLL OVER BEETHOVEN  (1987)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n06.05. DOO-WOP \n\n        Doo-wop is a style of vocal-based rhythm and blues music, which developed in African-American communities in the 1940s and which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s With its smooth, consonant vocal harmonies, doo-wop was one of the most mainstream, pop-oriented R&amp;B styles of the 1950s and 1960s.. There is confusion regarding which recording was the &quot;first&quot; to contain the phrase &quot;doo-wop&quot;. There is general acknowledgement that the first hit record to use the syllables &quot;doo-wop&quot; in the refrain was the 1955 hit, &quot;When You Dance&quot; by The Turbans, in which the chant &quot;doo-wop&quot; can clearly be heard . Important African American doo-wop groups included The Marcels, The Coasters, The Drifters, The Moonglows, Clovers,  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Little Anthony and the Imperials,The &quot;5&quot; Royales , The Flamingos , The Dells, The Cadillacs, The Midnighters and The Platters.\n\n\n         THE PLATTERS   -  ONLY YOU  (1956)\n         THE FLAMINGOS  -  WOULD I BE CRYING  (1956)\n         THE MOONGLOVES  -  I KNEW FROM THE START  (1956)\n         BROOK BENTON  -  IF ONLY I HAD YOU   (1957)\n         CLYDE  McPHATTER  - YOU ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“LL BE THERE   (1957)\n         FRANKIE LYMON  &amp; THE TEENAGERS  -  LOVE  PUT ME OUT OF MY HEAD (1957)\n         THE PLATTERS   -  SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES  (1958) \n         GENE CHANDLER -  DUKE OF EARL\n         THE PLATTERS  - THE GREAT PRETENDER\n\n\n\n\n06.06. SOUL MUSIC \n         Soul music has its roots in gospel music and rhythm and blues. The hard gospel vocal quartets of the 1940s and 1950s were big influences on major soul singers of the 1960s. Many consider the birthplace of soul music to be northern United States inner cities, particularly Chicago. Other cities, such as New York, Detroit, Memphis and Florence, quickly followed, creating their own soul styles based on their regional gospel roots. Sam Cook, Ray Charles Solomon Burke, Little Richard, James Brown,Fats Domino and  Aretha Franklin  are considered to be one of the pioneers and founders of soul music.\n\n \n         SAM COOKE  -  YOU SEND ME  (1957)\n         JACKIE WILSON  - LONELY TEARDROPS   (1958)\n         JACKIE WILSON  - I'M COMINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ON BACK TO YOU  (1961) \n         \n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5926c99d637bae85a2415689a9db471c9d7b5489","amp;dn":"HISTORY+OF+POP+AND+ROCK+MUSIC+-+part+278","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5926c99d637bae85a2415689a9db471c9d7b5489","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,38,201,157,99,123,174,133,162,65,86,137,169,219,71,28,157,123,84,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
