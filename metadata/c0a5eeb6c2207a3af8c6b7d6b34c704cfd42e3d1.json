The song sees the band return to their rock roots and features a violin solo by Mik Kaminski.\n\nThe song went through many changes during recording and at one point was going to be called &quot;Motor Factory&quot; with a completely different set of lyrics. The single proved to be ELO's last UK top twenty hit single, and reached #19 in the U.S.\n\n&quot;I sang on quite a few tracks; I sang on Rock 'n' Roll Is King. I played on that one, but it wasn't called that, it was something about something about working at Austin Longbridge! It was full of car plant sounds, you could hear it going clank, clank, clank, like somebody hitting a lathe with a hammer, and Jeff went away and made it into Rock 'n' Roll Is King, wiped off everything we'd done, no, there was still some backing left in there, It was much better how he finished it off than it was before.&quot; Dave Morgan (March 4, 1999 - King Of The Universe #8)\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_'n'_Roll_Is_King&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_'n'_Roll_Is_King&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PadMbaaDe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/PadMbaaDe&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9800kbps\n   Audio: MPEG Audio Layer 2, 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:05\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
