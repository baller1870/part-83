They lead us through the back gardens and narrow streets of towns and villages from Newcastle to Penzance to discover the most surprising of dances, ceremonies, rituals and festivities that mark the turning of the seasons and the passing of the year.\n\nOn their journey the Unthanks learn about the evolving history of the dances, whether connected to the land and the cycles of fertility or to working customs and practices in industrial towns. The girls talk to local historians and visit Cecil Sharp House to explore the dances' 20th century revival and codification through archivist Sharp and others, and we get to enjoy extraordinary film archive of the dances through the decades which show that although the people have changed, the dances have often remained remarkably constant.\n\nRachel and Becky grew up clog dancing in their native Northumberland and now get to observe and try other English dances, including travellers' step dancing in Suffolk, horn dancing with huge antlers in Staffordshire and stick dancing in Oxfordshire. This curious but vibrant world of local dances flies in the face of modernisation, and sometimes of ridicule, to keep the traditions and the steps alive.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgrtr&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wgrtr&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Streams: 2ch\nRunTime Per Part: 59 mins\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 731 MB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-T (BBC4)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbdc5ec1ead8b9165acfce5ba6510c14d8b99ab8","amp;dn":"BBC+Still+Folk+Dancing+After+All+These+Years+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbdc5ec1ead8b9165acfce5ba6510c14d8b99ab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,220,94,193,234,216,185,22,90,207,206,91,166,81,12,20,216,185,154,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
