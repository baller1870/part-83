While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano and bass guitar.\n\nComing to prominence in the late 1970s with The Soft Boys, Hitchcock afterward launched a prolific solo career. Hitchcock's musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Syd Barrett. Hitchcock's lyrics tend to include surrealism, comedic elements, characterisations of English eccentrics, and melancholy depictions of everyday life. His themes include the eternal contingencies of existence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ namely: death, sex, and eating. (Recognising these themes, he released an EP in 2007 called Sex, Food, Death and Tarantulas.)\n\nHe was signed to two major American labels (A&amp;M Records, then Warner Brothers) over the course of the 1980s and '90s, but mainstream success has been limited. Still, he has maintained a loyal cult following and has often earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Hitchcock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robyn_Hitchcock&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
