It allows you to play\nstereo scopic videos and DVDs\n(external decoder required) and also\nallows you to watch live video from a\ncapture device\n\nSince it is based on Direct Show, it\ncan handle almost any media format\nfor example AVI, MPEG, WMV and ASF\nVideos can be coded in several\ndifferent stereo scopic formats\n\nWhy is it necessary to use a special\nsoftware for 3D movie playback? The\nreason is that there are a lots of\ndifferent ways to watch stereoscopic\ncontent as well as different ways to\nstore the content\n\nIn the past, it was necessary to\nencode a stereoscopic movie for each\nviewing method, for example you had\nto create an anaglyph file, a\ninterlaced file for use with shutter\nglasses and a side-by-side for for\nfree-viewing without glasses\n\nQuality was often very low, because\nmost video codecs don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t handle\ninterlaced content well and subsample\ncolor information (reducing color\nresolution to quarter of original\nresolution), which reduces anaglyph\nquality dramatically\n\nURL:\n\n* iNSTALL NOTES *\n\n1.) Unpack and install\n2.) Use our patch to register\n3.) Enjoy!\n\nthanks to Illusion-iOTA\nFOR THE PATCH....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e9c59f455b6aa94ae63174f5d6613892f36efad","amp;dn":"Stereoscopiayerv1+6+6+with+patch+carter67","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e9c59f455b6aa94ae63174f5d6613892f36efad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,156,89,244,85,182,170,148,174,99,23,79,93,102,19,137,47,54,239,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
