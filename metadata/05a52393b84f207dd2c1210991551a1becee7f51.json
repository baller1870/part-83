Mississippi Delta-born Shirley Griffith learned to play guitar around age ten and was brought up on the country blues of Ishmon Bracey and Tommy Johnson. Although Griffith declined an offer to record with Tommy Johnson in 1928, he took his guitar to Indianapolis in the same year and fell under the influence of Scrapper Blackwell and Leroy Carr. In 1935, Carr asked Griffith to join him for a recording session in New York, but CarrÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sudden death delayed GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recording debut. Nonetheless, Griffith became a mainstay in the Indianapolis blues scene and worked for many years at a Chevrolet plant. At the encouragement of Arthur Rosenbaum, Griffith made his first recording with local guitarist J.T. Adams on Bluesville in 1964 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a full-length album appropriately titled Indiana Avenue Blues. (At the same time, Rosenbaum rediscovered GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longtime friend Scrapper Blackwell.) Later, Griffith released Saturday Blues (Bluesville, 1965) and Mississippi Blues (Blue Goose, 1973). Rooted in the country blues of the 1920s and 1930s, GriffithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s albums included many old standards as well as originals such as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIndiana Avenue BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIndianapolis JumpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (on a 1977 Flyright compilation). In his final years, he played locally and beyond with Yank Rachell and J. T. Adams. Along with other older bluesman, he made appearances at Ann ArborÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s inaugural blues fest in 1969 and twice in the early 1970s at the Midwest Blues Festival at Notre Dame.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05a52393b84f207dd2c1210991551a1becee7f51","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Shirley+Griffith+-+Mississippi+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05a52393b84f207dd2c1210991551a1becee7f51","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,165,35,147,184,79,32,125,210,193,33,9,145,85,26,27,236,238,127,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
