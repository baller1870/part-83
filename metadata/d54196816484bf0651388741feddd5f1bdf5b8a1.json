In a village situated close to the front but protected from it by a hillside, the body of Belle de Jour, a little girl, is found by the canal. Judge Mierck, assisted by an Colonel Matzev representing the Armed Forces, investigates the case in his own way. The fact that the young victim's corpse lies a few yards from the manor of Destinat, the withdrawn, haughty-looking district attorney, who has always despised and humiliated him, doesn't escape him. To make matters worse, a witness has seen the magistrate not only talking with Belle but patting her cheek as well minutes before the little girl was strangled. But vengeance is one thing and class privilege another...\n\nThe almost surreal and thrilling atmosphere, the mysterious labyrinth of fate, the brutality of the facts and the suavity of a choice poetry, the weirdness, the bizarre air, the flux of strangeness; also the skill, the craft, the science of delivering an exquisite show of ambiguity and bitterness ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦. Within the today cinema's context, these things are absolutely extraordinary. Grey Souls is a delicious film. Implausibly well acted (by a Marielle who keeps looking very old of so many years now ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦, and a ferocious, zoomorphic, no less able Villeret in one of his best roles ever).\n\n\n\nTHIS TORRENT HAS SUBTITLES IN ENGLISH AND FRENCH.\n\n\nThanks to those helping me seed.
