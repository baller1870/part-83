The series is about an &quot;average computer-whiz-next-door&quot; who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working in the CIA; the message embeds the only remaining copy of the world's greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.[1][2]\nProduced by College Hill Pictures, Wonderland Sound and Vision and Warner Bros. Television, the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on NBC, airing on Monday nights at 8/7c leading into Heroes.Despite receiving a full season pickup, the first season contained only thirteen episodes; production was stalled due to the 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“2008 Writers Guild of America strike.[5][6] The second season started on September 29, 2008, with a full 22-episode season order.[7] NBC released the first episode of season two a week before its air date via multiple online distribution methods, and cable on demand.\nEver since its premiere, Chuck has been a modestly rated show, and narrowly escaped cancellation several seasons in a row. In 2009, Chuck was renewed for a third season following a two-month campaign mounted by fans.[8] The season's initial 13-episode order was subsequently extended to nineteen episodes.[9] A major sponsorship deal between NBC and the Subway restaurant chain was also announced to help cover costs of the third season. The third season premiered with a 2-hour event on Sunday, January 10, 2010 before returning to its normal timeslot.[10] A 13-episode fourth season was picked up by NBC on May 13, 2010. The season later received an order for 11 additional episodes on October 18, 2010. Unlike the third season which was held as a midseason replacement, Chuck appears on NBC's fall 2010 schedule. Season 4 began airing on September 20, 2010.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(season_4)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_(season_4)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEncoded using Handbrake.\n\nSource of these files are 720p &amp; HDTV files..\n\nPlease seed atleast 1:1 &amp; remember to leave comments about the quality..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb07c6b0e0a443a09f5d185a322c9f2a52e2b0f","amp;dn":"Chuck+S04E01-10+%28PSP%2C+iPod%2C+Zune%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb07c6b0e0a443a09f5d185a322c9f2a52e2b0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,176,124,107,14,10,68,58,9,245,209,133,163,34,201,242,165,46,43,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
