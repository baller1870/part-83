SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a keenly observant writer and has an eye for detail way beyond that of a young artist, and there are some lyrics here that really stand out, notably on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Darkest DayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ where she paints a vivid picture of a stolen car and the story that unfolds.  \n\nMusically, this is appears fairly traditional with acoustic guitar taking the lead, with a band of mandolin, bass, dobro and more, but thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a definite contemporary feel in places that gives the album a unique atmosphere, and makes it stand out from the crowd ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s delicate, but much more complex and constructed than it first appears.\n\nVocally she shares many attributes with Griffin, the range and phrasing certainly have distinct similarities, and this is no bad thing as it makes the whole collection immediately engaging and somewhat familiar; but from the first listen in its obvious Halstead is ploughing her own furrow with her mix of traditional and contemporary themes.  \n\nThe addition of the 5 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Hollow BonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ tracks are a definite bonus, these tracks were written and recorded after the original release of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The River GraceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, but they follow on seamlessly and show the natural development of an artist.\n\nAll 15 tracks here show mark the arrival of a talented and impressive artist ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ this is a beautifully understated record, but everything is perfectly balanced resulting in one of the most memorable albums in recent memory. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed \n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/18/jenee-halstead/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd453ee45eb213b61db2e9416e4eadbe5030f656","amp;dn":"Jenee+Halstead...The+River+Grace%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd453ee45eb213b61db2e9416e4eadbe5030f656","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,69,62,228,94,178,19,182,29,178,233,65,110,78,173,190,80,48,246,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
