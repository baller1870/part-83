The word marijuana comes from the Mexican Spanish marihuana. According to the United Nations, cannabis &quot;is the most widely used illicit substance in the world\n\nThe major psychoactive chemical compound in cannabis is ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (commonly abbreviated as THC). Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, including at least 66 other cannabinoids (cannabidiol (CBD), cannabinol (CBN) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), etc.) which can result in different effects from those of THC alone.\n\nCannabis use has been found to have occurred as long ago as the third millennium B.C. In modern times, the drug has been used for recreational, religious or spiritual, and medicinal purposes. The UN estimated that in 2004 about 4% of the world's adult population (162 million people) use cannabis annually, and about 0.6% (22.5 million) use it on a daily basis.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5097c341a9860ae9721c385fd38e0cd1e19e33d1","amp;dn":"Drug+Class+-+Cannabis+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5097c341a9860ae9721c385fd38e0cd1e19e33d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,151,195,65,169,134,10,233,114,28,56,95,211,142,12,209,225,158,51,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
