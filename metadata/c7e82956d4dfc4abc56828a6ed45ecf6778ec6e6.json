The movie includes music videos, behind the scenes of preparation for SH3, and showcases their day-to-day antics over the last 2 years. Full of stunts, pranks, and comedic skits, the movie is broken into segments that range from funny to painful to downright nauseating. The crew wishes that viewers understand that with or without a camera rolling, this film shows their true behaviors. &quot;That's the best part,&quot; says cast member Lehman Mann, &quot;the movie shows what really goes on. We didn't fake anything or act differently. That's just the way it is. If anything, I would say this movie tones it down.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7e82956d4dfc4abc56828a6ed45ecf6778ec6e6","amp;dn":"AwShit%21FULL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7e82956d4dfc4abc56828a6ed45ecf6778ec6e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,232,41,86,212,223,196,171,197,104,40,166,237,69,236,246,119,142,198,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
