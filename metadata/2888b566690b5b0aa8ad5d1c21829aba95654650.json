The victims, mostly women and children, were mauled and decapitated, their naked bodies all bearing the bite marks of a non-human creature. The killings mark the largest number of alleged werewolf attacks in history and are the basis of the Hollywood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWolfmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ legend.\n\nVenture deep into the mythology and folklore of werewolves with renowned cryptozoologist Ken Gerhardt and veteran criminal profiler George Deuchar as they investigate this reviled creature that brutally kills when the moon is full. In their investigation, they uncover intriguing paranormal transformations, diseases that make men look and act like animals, strange but true stories of children raised by wolves and, eventually, the dark side of human nature in the horrific truth behind the Gevaudan werewolf attacks.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2888b566690b5b0aa8ad5d1c21829aba95654650","amp;dn":"The+Real+Wolfman++%28History+Channel%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2888b566690b5b0aa8ad5d1c21829aba95654650","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,136,181,102,105,11,91,10,168,173,93,28,33,130,154,186,149,101,70,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
