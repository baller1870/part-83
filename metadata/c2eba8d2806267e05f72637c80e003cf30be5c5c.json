Midnight Hour [11:06]\nNotes:\nThe 8th song, previously notated as &quot;unknown instrumental&quot; on Deadlists, is a cover of Freddy King's &quot;Heads Up.&quot; The 9th tune, previously listed as &quot;The Same Thing (instrumental),&quot; is definitely NOT that song. Although it is a\nstandard blues and sounds similar at the beginning, closer listening makes it pretty obvious that it is an entirely different song, title unknown. The Viola Lee Blues on this expanded version is a different version than on the\nprevious three song version of Pico Acid Test. This is an ongoing mystery, although it should be said that both versions are worth having.\nTotal time: 74:04\n\nDISC SIX:Supplementary CD2 - San Francisco State Acid Test (alternate version) (41:56)\n&quot;Whatever It Is&quot; Festival October 2, 1966\nSan Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA\nStereo Control Room Master (rec. 4:00AM - 6:00AM)\nSource(s) unknown, this has different lineage, and some different edits to the &quot;intact&quot; version.
