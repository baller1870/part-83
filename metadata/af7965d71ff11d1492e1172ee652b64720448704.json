A ninja movie with the smooth cool effects you'd hope for, some cinematography reminiscent of 300, and the old west verses ninjas. How cool is that? Well....unfortunately, not as cool as you'd think. There was a clip on Xbox Live that shows the first 2 minutes of the movie. The crummy thing is, after that first two minutes of setting up the stylish ninja effects and sword play...you don't see anymore of it till about the last 20 minutes of the movie. And that's exaggerating. Quick fight scene at the start. Long action scene at the end. And all the stuff in between is mush. I'm not saying I don't enjoy a movie with a good plot, but c'mon...there was only reason why any guy went to see this movie---ninjas...and cowboys VERSES ninjas. They didn't go to watch a lengthy story about a ninja falling in love and getting soft. Me and my buddies were really stoked about this movie going in, but I just really can't say it was that great. I actually liked the cinematography and the sets, but it just didn't use it enough to it's advantage. And to be honest, I really wasn't that impressed by the sword play. It was like the main character was never touched and he only had one move--slice. There wasn't any fancy flipping around and doing crazy stunts. It was just: ninja comes at him, he slices, they die. Rinse and repeat. No special way of doing it, just the same move every time. It didn't even look like any training was necessary. They just handed him the fake sword and told him whenever a guy gets near him, swing at 'em, and we'll add the blood in later.\n\nThe only other thing I can say is that Kate Bosworth's accent was TERRIBLE and annoying. I know it was supposed to be a little thick, but that was just a little much. And the funny thing was, as the movie progressed, it got less thick.\n\nAnyways, wait for this to come out on DVD at best. Believe me, this is not nearly as cool as it could, or SHOULD, have been.\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/95521316153253938506.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://img855.imageshack.us/img855/5478/vlcsnap2011030212h08m05.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img21.imageshack.us/img21/1961/vlcsnap2011030212h09m36.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img217.imageshack.us/img217/269/vlcsnap2011030212h09m59.png[/img]\n\n[img]http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/1279/vlcsnap2011030212h07m39.png[/img]\n\n\nSource used     \n\nIFLIX  - Thanks \n\nWasnt going to do this one as retail will be pretty soon but had some time so had a go at it.Ran a few filters through it as much as i could.\n\nEnjoy !\n\n\n\n\nGreetz to Imagine ,Flawl3ss ,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom, BDK, TOXiC, iNK, THC, Ez, Rx,\n\n\n\n\n\n[img]http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6898/sig1n.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af7965d71ff11d1492e1172ee652b64720448704","amp;dn":"The+Warriors+Way+2010+XviD+PPVRip+SAFCuk009+DTRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af7965d71ff11d1492e1172ee652b64720448704","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,121,101,215,31,241,29,20,146,225,23,46,230,82,182,71,32,68,135,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
