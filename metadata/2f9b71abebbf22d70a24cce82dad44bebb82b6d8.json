But, when I heard &quot;Doorbell&quot; a few years back I became an instant fan. That raw, classic sound was so fresh to me. I went straight to iTunes and downloaded the whole album. It wasn't long before I owned everything they'd ever released. \n\nWhat really got me was that I wanted to sample almost every song. But, I couldn't just shamelessly sample their whole catalog. Plus, I had just decided to move away from sampling and focus on writing original music. So, a remix project seemed like the thing to do, and the idea was born. \n\nI started digging through my collection and fitting all the pieces together. My goal was to use only samples from The White Stripes and a cappellas from classic songs and my favorite emcees. And of course, I had to rap on one of the tracks myself, with my man Brian Jacobs on the hook. \n\nSo there it is, hip-hop fans, meet The White Stripes.\nFans of The White Stripes, meet hip-hop. \n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Adrian Champion\n\n01 Bombs Over Orchids (The White Stripes + Outkast)\n02 Icky Says (The White Stripes + Pharoahe Monch)\n03 Ante Up Every Way (The White Stripes + M.O.P.)\n04 Turn It Up (The White Stripes + Kanye West)\n05 Ms. Doorbell (The White Stripes + Mos Def)\n06 Cash Run (The White Stripes + Notorious B.I.G. &amp; 2Pac)\n07 Got Yourself A Cannon (The White Stripes + Jay-Z)\n08 Jolene\\'s Ether (The White Stripes + Nas)\n09 One More Corner (The White Stripes + Common)\n10 Dangerous Love (The White Stripes + Busta Rhymes)\n11 Fucking Apples (The White Stripes + Eminem)\n12 Tha Countdown Blues (The White Stripes + Redman)\n13 Stars &amp; Stripes (The White Stripes + Adrian Champion &amp; Brian Jacobs)\n\n\n\n\n\n[mixtape torrent]\n\n\nseed.\n\n\n\ndon't drink &amp; drive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f9b71abebbf22d70a24cce82dad44bebb82b6d8","amp;dn":"Adrian+Champion+Presents+-+Stars%26Stripes+%28The+White+Stripes+Reim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f9b71abebbf22d70a24cce82dad44bebb82b6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,155,113,171,235,191,34,215,10,36,204,232,45,173,68,190,187,130,182,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
