Born on March 22, 1931, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Perhaps best known for his roles on Boston Legal and Star Trek, William Shatner is one of the most recognizable stars working today. His distinctive voice and cadence have been the subject of many imitations, spoofs, and parodies-all contributing to his status as a pop icon. In addition to being an Emmy Award-winning actor, he has also written numerous books, directed several projects, and even recorded a few albums.\n\nFile Size ------- 349mb\nLength ---------- 40:45\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- mkv\nVideo Codec ----- x264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 30\n\np h a t w a r e z . t k\nThanks to (anonymous) for the generous seedbox donation.\nAlso supported by:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://magnet-dev.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85e2dd28ccb378aa0922e6b2a7d0eb8d4fed7af3","amp;dn":"Biography+Channel%3A+William+Shatner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85e2dd28ccb378aa0922e6b2a7d0eb8d4fed7af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,226,221,40,204,179,120,170,9,34,230,178,167,208,235,141,79,237,122,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
