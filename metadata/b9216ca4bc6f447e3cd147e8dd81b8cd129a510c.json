It was certified Gold on December 20, 1989 by the RIAA. It is the first Kiss studio album since 1981's Music from &quot;The Elder&quot; to feature three members singing lead on the album. It also marked the last Kiss album with drummer Eric Carr before his death in 1991.\n\nFeaturing 15 songs, Hot in the Shade contains the largest amount of material of any of Kiss's studio albums. Consequently, the album is also one of the band's longest, with a running time of nearly a full hour (58:39).\n\nGene Simmons and Paul Stanley appeared in Kiss makeup for the first time since their 1983 unmasking in the video for &quot;Rise to It.&quot; Although the scene with Gene and Paul in makeup took place in 1975, the costumes they used were historically inaccurate; Gene's was from the Unmasked (1980) era while Paul's was from Love Gun (1977).\n\nTommy Thayer, who co-wrote &quot;Betrayed&quot; and &quot;The Street Giveth And The Street Taketh Away,&quot; eventually became Kiss's permanent lead guitarist in 2002, replacing Ace Frehley as &quot;The Spaceman.&quot;\n\nKiss performed the song &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot; on their 1990 Hot in the Shade tour, which followed this album. Stanley would once again perform the song during his 2006-2007 Live to Win solo tour.\n\nAside from &quot;Forever&quot;, a constant fixture on the band's live performances, the album has been largely ignored on live shows following the reunion of the original lineup in the mid-1990s.\n\nIn 1983, Kiss abandoned its makeup and profited from a commercial resurgence throughout the rest of the decade. Buoyed by a wave of Kiss nostalgia in the 1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting Kiss Alive/Worldwide/Lost Cities/Reunion Tour was the top-grossing act of 1996 and 1997. Criss and Frehley have since left Kiss again and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform with makeup, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members.\n\nKiss was named 10th, by VH1, on their list of the '100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock.' and 9th on 'The Greatest Metal Bands' list by MTV. On September 23, 2009, Kiss was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, ten years after becoming eligible but on December 15, 2009 it was announced that Kiss did not make it into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9216ca4bc6f447e3cd147e8dd81b8cd129a510c","amp;dn":"Kiss+-+Rise+To+It+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9216ca4bc6f447e3cd147e8dd81b8cd129a510c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,33,108,164,188,111,68,126,60,209,71,232,221,129,184,205,18,154,81,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
