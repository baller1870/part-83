Reble's unfamiliar chemistry generates slowly pulsating structures and colors. Micro- and macroscopic imagery build a near-abstract, hypnotic landscape -- an intimate perception of creation..&quot;\nJurgen Reble, former member of the German filmmaking group &quot;Schmelzdahin&quot; (dissolved in 1989), focuses on exploring the film material through bacterial processes, weathering and chemical treatment during and after development.\n&quot;The basic idea is that it is impossible to fix film. Film is something which is always in a state of flux... The images, &quot;real&quot; in the beginning, gradually disintegrate and the gelatine layer -- where the chemicals are embedded -- dissolves. All that's left in the end is the 'raging of the elements'..&quot;\n\nscreenshots: https://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?id=383\n\nFile info:\n\nNot my rip/encode, thanks to whoever shared it!\n\n    File Size (in bytes) ............................: 733,341,696 bytes\n    Runtime ............................................: 52:50.699\n\n    Video Codec ...................................: XviD 1.1.2 Final\n    Frame Size ......................................: 512x384 (AR: 1.333)\n    FPS .................................................: 29.970\n    Video Bitrate ...................................: 1732 kb/s\n    Bits per Pixel ...................................: 0.294 bpp\n    B-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\n    Audio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n    Sample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\n    Audio Bitrate ...................................: 104 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR\n    No. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ***********************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
