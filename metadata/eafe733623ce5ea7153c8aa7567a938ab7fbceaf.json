I take no credit for the files/cracks, \nonly in putting them in one lovely place.\n\n\n\n\n1. Install Sims 3\n\n*** EDITED HERE ***\n*** PLEASE READ ***\n\nI had realized that the instructions I provided are not 100% correct. \nBe sure to download this update from the Sims Wiki patch-archive.\n\n       &lt;a href=&quot; http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/TS3_1.15.34.008002_Update.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\n        Update to 1.15.xxx   (NOT 1.18.xxx as initially indicated)\n\t\n2. Install Downloadable Content\n\tCopy 'Documents' folder to C:\\Users\\%username%\\\n\tInstall the two neighborhoods\n\n3. Install High-End\n\tUpdate\n\n4. Install Wolrd Adventures\n\tUpdate\n\n5. Install Ambitions\n\tDON'T UPDATE, INSTALL FASTLANE FIRST\n\n6. Install FastLane\n\tUpdate Ambitions and then FastLanes\n\n*** EDITED HERE ***\n*** PLEASE READ ***\n\n        The update provided in the torrent for FastLanes is the wrong patch.\nFollow the link provided to apply the propper patch. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/Sims3_5.4.4.009001_from_5.0.44.008001.exe&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://akamai.cdn.ea.com/eadownloads/u/f/sims/sims3/patches/Sims3_5.4.4.009001_from_5.0.44.008001.exe&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFollowing this step, update the Base Game to 1.18, from its current 1.15.\nIf you do not update, you will not be able to install Late Night.\n\n7. Install Late Night\n\tUpdate\n\n8. Apply No-CD Late Night crack, and play\n       \tBack up originals before applying cracks\n\tC:\\Program Files (x86)\\Electronic Arts\\The Sims 3 Late Night\\Game\\Bin\t\n\t(Crack tells you that it is an unoffical mod that may cause bugs. Hit continue)\n\n9. Use the cracked TS3EP03.exe to play! Enjoy it for free!\n\n\n\nSorry about the edits on step 1 and step 6, I thought I had it all perfected before I packed it, but I hope this all helps.\nI also realized my disc 2 and 3 are mislabeled. (Disc 2 is called World Adventures and is actually High-End Loft Stuff, vice-versa)\nJust follow them in the order they are numbered. That is what works.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eafe733623ce5ea7153c8aa7567a938ab7fbceaf","amp;dn":"The+Sims+3+Complete+-+12-2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eafe733623ce5ea7153c8aa7567a938ab7fbceaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,254,115,54,35,206,94,167,21,60,138,167,86,122,147,138,183,251,206,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
