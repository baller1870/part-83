Fully tested in Ubuntu 10.04, ArchLinux and Slackware Linux.\n\nCorkScrews are prepackaged wine prefixes inspired by the &quot;Wine bottle&quot; of\nCrossover (cxgames.) They have been built, tested, and packaged on a \nslackware system and should run on any Linux distribution running wine.\n\nDo not rely on wine 1.0.1 to run CorkScrews. The installer script template \ncould use a little more cleaning up (and will be cleaned up before my next \nCorkScrew) but this one works and is thoroughly tested. Once the game \nis untarred run scripts will be placed in $HOME/bin.\n\nLaunch the game using the run script. Some of my more recent CorkScrews have\nuninstall scripts in $HOME/bin as well, although these should not be \nexecutable by default I think one of them is (not sure for which game.)\n\nI encourage you to package, test, and distribute CorkScrews of other games.\n\nI also encourage you to repackage CorkScrews into distro specific packages\nor add Desktop Environment friendly buttons or whatever other frilly shit you\nlike.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7585bbf1fd941d3eb60870f9dd61f693f69fd702","amp;dn":"CorkScrew+Fallout+1+%26+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7585bbf1fd941d3eb60870f9dd61f693f69fd702","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,133,187,241,253,148,29,62,182,8,112,249,221,97,246,147,246,159,215,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
