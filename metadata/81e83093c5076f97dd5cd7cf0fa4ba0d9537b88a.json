Kelly is a self-proclaimed runaway bride. SheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been engaged four times but says she gets cold feet before she makes it down the aisle. Rick, her current fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©, proposed four years ago and is still waiting for her to set a wedding date. Kelly believes that most marriages end in divorce, and she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to become another statistic. Should Rick wait for her to make up her mind, or should he cut his losses and move on? Then, Chad and Candi have been engaged for over five years and have two daughters, but Chad says heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not ready to tie the knot. He says weddings are too expensive, but Candi says he racked up $49,000 in loans for a car, a camper and a new deck for the house. Will Chad break down and give his fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e the wedding of her dreams? Plus, Dr. Phil talks to a woman who says her fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© left her six days before the wedding and stuck her with a $150,000 bill!
