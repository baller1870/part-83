The Tramp adopts a street kid (Jackie Coogan), in a seamless blend of slapstick and sentiment. For A Woman of Paris (1923), Chaplin experimented: straight, adult melodrama, with no Charlie onscreen (save for a brief cameo). 1927ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s The Circus is prized by many Chaplin critics as pure sublime comedy, less burdened by sentiment or politics than subsequent films. City Lights (1931) is an undisputed masterpiece; the Tramp befriends a blind girl, leading to one of the great bittersweet endings in film history. (Among the extras: a priceless seven-minute deleted scene involving little more than Chaplin and a piece of wood stuck in a grate.) With Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Chaplin turned his back on the Tramp and invented an elegant lady killer (literally); audiences disapproved, but the film stands as a fascinating essay on himself. Finally, after his exile from the United States, Chaplin made A King in New York (1957), which is mostly flat, except as autobiography.\n\nThe Circus \nBlack &amp; White \nRunning time: 69 minutes approx. \n\nCity Lights \nBlack &amp; White \nRunning Time: 82 minutes approx. \n\nThe Kid \nBlack &amp; White \nRunning time: 50 minutes approx. \n\nMonsieur Verdoux \nBlack &amp; White \nRunning time: 119 minutes approx. \nPlus 2 bonus titles: \nA King in New York \nA Woman of Paris\nI HAVE TRYED TO LEAVE SUBTITLES SUB FILE INCLUDED MULTI SUBS\nENJOY\n\n\n\n\nCaptured Images ----&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/2894/vlcsnap2010121621h42m41.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img522.imageshack.us/img522/2894/vlcsnap2010121621h42m41.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/5089/vlcsnap2010121621h42m33.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img401.imageshack.us/img401/5089/vlcsnap2010121621h42m33.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4410/vlcsnap2010121621h43m11.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4410/vlcsnap2010121621h43m11.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/7848/vlcsnap2010121621h43m43.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img525.imageshack.us/img525/7848/vlcsnap2010121621h43m43.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e90de61393cda87c5656a86ae1c09e1075f1138","amp;dn":"The+Chaplin+Collection+%5BDvd+Rips%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e90de61393cda87c5656a86ae1c09e1075f1138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,144,222,97,57,60,218,135,197,101,106,134,174,28,9,225,7,95,17,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
