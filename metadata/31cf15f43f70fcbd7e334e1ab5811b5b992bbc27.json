Just some of the extraordinary and weird new species chosen by presenter Chris Packham as his top ten discoveries of the last decade from around the world.\n\nAlso chosen are a giant orchid worth thousands, a walking shark and a small mammal related to an elephant with a nose to match, and two geckos which are evolving before our eyes. Equally extraordinary are the personal stories of how the new species were found, as told by the 21st\ncentury scientists and explorers who discovered them - the Indiana Joneses of the natural world.\nAll these species are new to us and new to science, and proof that the Earth can still surprise us.\n\n\n\nAspect Ratio......: 16:9\nResolution: 832x468\nFPS.......: 25.000\nVideo Codec: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nVideo Bitrate: 1500 kb/s\nLanguage: English.\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/7241/53288005.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/7241/53288005.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/484/82994092.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img152.imageshack.us/img152/484/82994092.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1516/27125091.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img804.imageshack.us/img804/1516/27125091.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31cf15f43f70fcbd7e334e1ab5811b5b992bbc27","amp;dn":"Decade+of+Discovery+-+BBC+Science+%26+Nature","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31cf15f43f70fcbd7e334e1ab5811b5b992bbc27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,207,21,244,63,112,252,189,126,51,78,26,181,129,27,91,153,43,188,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
