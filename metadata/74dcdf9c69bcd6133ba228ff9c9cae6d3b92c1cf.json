Planet B contains various environments, including schools, the Wild West, and Ancient Rome.\n\nLioba commits suicide in the real world by throwing herself off a cliff, to the distress and horror of her boyfriend John Armstrong. John then downloads himself into Planet B and enters a section called &quot;Golden Moments&quot; which allows him to play the best moments of his life, but a technical fault results in him being forced to constantly watch Lioba's funeral. John, along with his virtual hostess and guide Medley, discover that the problem revolves around Lioba. John then begins to see memories that are not his but Lioba's. He therefore begins to believe that Lioba is still alive somewhere in Planet B. John and Medley decide to search Planet B in an attempt to find her by jumping into a rift in the system, taking part in the various games and worlds in the system as they go along. However, when they exit the rift, John is no longer his avatar, but himself with his DNA digitised. As a result, he feels everything in Planet B for real, and if he is killed in a game, he will really die.[\n\n\nCast:\nGunnar Cauthery\nDonnla Hughes\nLizzy Watts\nChris Pavlo\n\nThe series was created by Sam Hoyle, Jessica Dromgoole and Matthew Broughton with James Robinson.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_B&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_B&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlanet B - S01 - E01 - Golden Moments\nPlanet B - S01 - E02 - New Boy\nPlanet B - S01 - E03 - Freakshow\nPlanet B - S01 - E04 - New Rome\nPlanet B - S01 - E05 - The Smart Money\nPlanet B - S01 - E06 - The Wild Gang\nPlanet B - S01 - E07 - Catharsis\nPlanet B - S01 - E08 - Retreat\nPlanet B - S01 - E09 - The Fast Track\nPlanet B - S01 - E10 - Deaths Door\n\nPlanet B - S02 - E01 - The Tender Trap \nPlanet B - S02 - E02 - Make A Wish \nPlanet B - S02 - E03 - Paradise Hazard \nPlanet B - S02 - E04 - Light City \nPlanet B - S02 - E05 - Dark Star\n\nPlanet B - S03 - E01 - Haunted\nPlanet B - S03 - E02 - The Pirate Islands\nPlanet B - S03 - E03 - Doing Time\nPlanet B - S03 - E04 - Disaster!\nPlanet B - S03 - E05 - The End Of The Rogue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 30mn 00s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74dcdf9c69bcd6133ba228ff9c9cae6d3b92c1cf","amp;dn":"Planet+B+-+S01+to+03+-+SciFi+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74dcdf9c69bcd6133ba228ff9c9cae6d3b92c1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,220,223,156,105,188,214,19,59,162,40,255,156,156,174,109,59,146,193,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
