Based on Howard Hawks' original 1932 film of the same name, the film tells the story of a fictional Cuban refugee who comes to Miami in 1980 as a result of the Mariel Boatlift. Montana becomes a gangster against the backdrop of the 1980s cocaine boom. The film chronicles his rise to the top of Miami's criminal underworld and subsequent downfall in tragic Greek fashion.\n\nThe film is dedicated to Howard Hawks and Ben Hecht, who were the director and screenwriter respectively of the original 1932 film.\n\nThe initial critical response to Scarface was mixed, with the film receiving criticism for its violence and graphic language. The film has since gathered a cult following and has become an important cultural icon, inspiring posters, clothing, and many other references. The film's grainy black and white poster is a popular decoration and is still in production; as a result of its popularity it has been parodied many times.\n\nIn June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;Ten Top Ten&quot;ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the best ten films in ten &quot;classic&quot; American film genresÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. Scarface was acknowledged as the tenth best in the gangster film genre. The line &quot;Say hello to my little friend!&quot; (said by Montana of his rifle-grenade-launcher) took 61st place on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list. Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #8 on their list of &quot;The Top 50 Cult Films&quot;,and Empire Magazine placed it among the top 500 films of all time.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Scarface (1983)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢]\\Scarface (1983)[DVDRip][big_dad_eÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat profile                   : OpenDML\nFile size                        : 3.44 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 49mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 898 Kbps\nWriting application              : Lavf51.12.1\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DX50\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 5\nDuration                         : 2h 49mn\nBit rate                         : 2 567 Kbps\nWidth                            : 852 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.262\nStream size                      : 3.04 GiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : Lavc51.40.4\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 49mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 389 MiB (11%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 26 ms (0.63 video frame)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.97\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5160\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/21/2010 2:41:30 AM\nmbam-log-2010-11-21 (02-41-30).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 6\nTime elapsed: 11 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n\nRequests?
