Then again, the nature of the blues is that every musician who plays it stamps his or her own identity on a set of familiar chord changes and songs. While it might not feel like the blues, Aerosmith do indeed stamp their identity on each track on their long-promised blues album, the atrociously named Honkin' on Bobo. Other rockers who have cut full-length blues albums have always played the music with a kind of scholarly reverence, taking care to pay tribute to their influences. Not Aerosmith. They turn up the amps and cut loose, playing slick and sleazy blooze-rock that feels indebted to second-generation blues-rock instead of blues forefathers. But that's the nature of the band. \n\n Track Listing....: \n 01.Road runner [03:45] \n 02.Shame, shame, shame [02:15] \n 03.Eyesight to the blind [03:11] \n 04.Baby, please don't go [03:24] \n 05.Never loved A girl [03:12] \n 06.Back back train [04:23] \n 07.You gotta move [05:31] \n 08.The grind [03:47] \n 09.I'm ready [04:15] \n 10.Temperature [02:51] \n 11.Stop messin' around [04:32] \n 12.Jesus is on the main line [02:49] \n ____ \n \n 43:55 min \n 73,3 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d30580fda08e99e391288bc44f1c21536669f353","amp;dn":"Aerosmith-Honkin_On_Bobo-%28Retail%29-2004-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d30580fda08e99e391288bc44f1c21536669f353","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,5,128,253,160,142,153,227,145,40,139,196,79,28,33,83,102,105,243,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
