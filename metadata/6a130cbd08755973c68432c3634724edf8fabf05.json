But look a bit deeper under the hood, and what you find is actually just another singer/songwriter with a bit more gloss and shinier, go-faster stripes. Her insights aren't especially insightful, and she can slide in a good turn of phrase here and there, and the excerpts from &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; work well on &quot;Somewhere,&quot; but the bottom line is that for much of this disc she's just fairly average, a talent that's still developing. She might become something special, since there are glimmers of the great hiding in &quot;Song for Jeffrey Lucey.&quot; But we'll see what happens when she's shaken off the college creative writing course and fully found her own voice.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/29/meg-hutchinson/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/29/meg-hutchinson/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a130cbd08755973c68432c3634724edf8fabf05","amp;dn":"Meg+Hutchinson...Come+Up+Full%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a130cbd08755973c68432c3634724edf8fabf05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,19,12,189,8,117,89,115,198,132,50,195,99,71,36,237,248,250,191,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
