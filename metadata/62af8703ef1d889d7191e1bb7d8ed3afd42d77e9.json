The soundtrack is amazing, as is the imagery. Highly recommended. And by that I mean recommended to watch while high.\n\nCurrently on Falzon's website is listed a 2-DVD set with a second DVD of short films - this is the older single DVD version of just the film.\n\n.\nThe classic surf film Morning of the Earth reveals a fantasy of three exotic lands: Bali, Hawaii and Australia, where surfers made their own houses, surfboards and lived in harmony with nature.\n\nFeaturing spectacular surfing from Nat Young, Terry Fitzgerald, Gerry Lopez, Stephen Cooney, David Treloar and Micheal Peterson with stunning photography from Albert Falzon and a great original rock soundtrack that tells this mood story far better than any words.\n\nDirector/Cinematography: Albert Falzon\nMusic Producer: G. Wayne Thomas\n\nMusic by Terry Hannigan, Peter Howe, Taman Shud, John J. Francis, Brian Cadd, Ticket, G. Wayne Thomas.\n\n\nthanks goes to currituckco @ tik","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62af8703ef1d889d7191e1bb7d8ed3afd42d77e9","amp;dn":"Morning+of+the+Earth+%281971%29+NTSC+DVD5+VIDEO_TS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62af8703ef1d889d7191e1bb7d8ed3afd42d77e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,175,135,3,239,29,136,157,113,145,225,187,125,142,211,175,212,45,119,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
