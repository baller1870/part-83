The focus of the plot, however, is actually on the three officers themselves who stumble upon an opportunity to capitalize on the information they gathered during their surveillance. The audience is given insights into the personal issues they are grappling with, the relationship between them, and why the temptation to breach their moral duty and professional obligations is so powerful. The temptation they confront and the attendant reasons that compel them to succumb to it become the very device that turns them into the film's antagonists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea924c2db2e12daeaffd439e65d16b3a22cbbe9d","amp;dn":"Overheard+-+Qie+ting+feng+yun+%282009%29+-+PT+BR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea924c2db2e12daeaffd439e65d16b3a22cbbe9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,146,76,45,178,225,45,174,175,253,67,158,101,209,107,58,34,203,190,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
