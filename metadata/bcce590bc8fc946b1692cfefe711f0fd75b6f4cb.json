[Ed Sullivan 1966].VOB\n\n\nHQ very rare Ed Sullivan Show performance. &quot;Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?&quot; is a song by the English rock and roll band The Rolling Stones. It first appeared as a single in September 1966 and was included as the opening track on theversion of their 1966 compilation album Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass). \n\nWritten by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, the song was recorded in the late summer of 1966. It is famous for its horns arrangement (arranged by Mike Leander; this is the first Rolling Stones song to feature brass) and is one of the earliest songs to use feedback from the guitars. The Stones have said that they were unhappy with the final cut, bemoaning the loss of the original cut's strong rhythm section. \n\nIt was released as a single in September 1966 simultaneously in the United Kingdom and the United States (a first for the band), and reached #5 and #9 on those country's charts, respectively.\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_You_Seen_Your_Mother,_Baby,_Standing_in_the_Shadow%3F&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_You_Seen_Your_Mother,_Baby,_Standing_in_the_Shadow%3F&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EaBfBaAda&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EaBfBaAda&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8600kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:26\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
