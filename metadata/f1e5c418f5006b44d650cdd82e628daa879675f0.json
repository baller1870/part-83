Acclaim Entertainment\nPublishers \tAcclaim, Virgin Interactive(3DO)\nGenres \t        Action, Platform\n\n\nDemolition Man is a multiplatform action video game based on the film of the same name with running and gunning elements. The player controls the main character, John Spartan as he attempts to find and defeat his arch-nemesis, Simon Phoenix. Even though he is the final boss of the game, the player has to fight him in short-lived &quot;teaser&quot; battles before defeating him for good at the cryo-prison.\n\nThis emasculation of the movie eliminates all of the comedic elements and turns the game into a straight action game with minor witty comments that appeared on the SNES and the Sega Genesis versions of the game. Examples of these minor witty comments included statements like &quot;you look great today&quot; and &quot;avoid fatty foods.&quot; Hardcore fans of the movie would eventually find out that the &quot;talking computer&quot; can only utter MDK repeatedly in the game. Even with this limitation in mind, the game can keep track of the player's score and how many people he has killed. Due to the game's Kids-to-Adults rating, there is no adult language as seen in the movie. When players see the machines that gave out fines for &quot;violating the verbal morality stature&quot; in the movie, they are considered to be mere decorations in the video game.\n\nAll references to Taco Bell have been eliminated because the Taco Bell restaurant is part of a side story involving Raymond Cocteau, Lenina Huxley, and John Spartan; it has nothing to do with the main quest of apprehending Simon Phoenix. The gunmen in the game are assumed to belong to Edgar Friendly; the movie mentions about a resistance army in the sewers rebelling against Raymond Cocteau's control of San Angeles. Simon Phoenix does not gather an army of his own until late in the movie and Edgar Friendly is the only one who has the charisma to recruit a mass number of gunmen from the start of the 2032 (future) segment of the film. There is also another stage that was never in the movie; the maglev train level. In this level, John Spartan must navigate through a futuristic train. He must try to avoid either getting killed by the thugs or the devices controlled by the train's central processing unit. The object of that level was to stop the train before it went uncontrollably fast. The futuristic parking lot level introduced a robotic villain that was never seen in the film; a renegade car crusher that attacked the player with automobiles.\n\n...................................................................................\n\n\nHow to start the game:\n\n1.
