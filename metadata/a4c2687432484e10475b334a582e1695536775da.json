Shelley started writing the story when she was eighteen and the novel was published when she was nineteen. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in France.\n\nThrough research it can be determined the many influences the author was under during the creation of the novel. She had traveled the region in which the story takes place, and the topics of galvanism and such other occult ideas were themes of conversation among her companions. Frankenstein is infused with some elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement, and is also considered to be one of the earliest examples of science fiction. It was also a warning against the expansion of modern man in the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The story has had an influence across literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films.\n\n\nCast -\nFrankenstein - Michael Maloney\nThe Creature - John Wood\nJohn Walton - Phillip Joseph\nElizabeth - Janys Chambers\nHenry - Paul Panting\nAlphonse - Ted Richards\nDe Lacey - Gavin Muir\nWilliam - Sam Crane\nAlso starring\nJames Berwick\nPeter Caffrey\nFrances Jeater\nNeville Jason\nDeborah Berlin\nDon McCorkindale\nMalcolm Ward\nPeter Kenny\nDavid Jarvis\nMargaret John.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/frankenstein.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/frankenstein.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFrankenstein - 01 of 02\nFrankenstein - 02 of 02\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 58mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4c2687432484e10475b334a582e1695536775da","amp;dn":"Frankenstein+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4c2687432484e10475b334a582e1695536775da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,194,104,116,50,72,78,16,71,91,51,74,88,46,22,149,83,103,117,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
