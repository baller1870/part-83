This work is extremely important not only for Russian cinema; it became a landmark in the history of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cinematograph. For the first time a specific method of montage had been used in this film, which came to be known later as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoviet montageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Despite the fact that KuleshovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s films had preceded many discoveries of Vertov and Eisenstein, his works are little known outside Russia. Among his students were Vsevolod Pudovkin and Boris Barnet. In the introduction to KuleshovÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s book The Art of Cinema (1928), his former students wrote: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIt was on his shoulders that we crossed into the open sea. We make films ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Kuleshov made cinematographyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nCast: Boris Kuleshov, Yelena Komarova, Ernest KulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ganek, Lev Kuleshov\n\nLev Vladimirovich Kuleshov (1899 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1970) was a Soviet filmmaker and film theorist who taught at and helped establish the world's first film school (the Moscow Film School).\n\nKuleshov may well be the very first film theorist as he was a leader in Soviet montage theory ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ developing his theories of editing before those of Sergei Eisenstein (briefly a student of Kuleshov) and Vsevolod Pudovkin. For Kuleshov, the essence of the cinema was editing, the juxtaposition of one shot with another. To illustrate this principle, he created what has come to be known as the Kuleshov Experiment. In this now-famous editing exercise, shots of an actor were intercut with various meaningful images (a casket, a bowl of soup, and so on) in order to show how editing changes viewers' interpretations of images.\n\nIn addition to his theoretical work, Kuleshov was an active director of feature-length films till 1943. Since 1943 Kuleshov was serving as the academic rector of Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography.\n\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Proekt inzhenera Prayta.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 421 MiB\n      Duration : 30mn 27s\n      Overall bit rate : 1 934 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 30mn 27s\n      Bit rate : 1 733 Kbps\n      Width : 688 pixels\n      Height : 512 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.197\n      Stream size : 377 MiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 30mn 27s\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 41.8 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 40 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0009522/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0009522/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian Intertitles; English, French, Spanisn, Italian, German, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian subpack\n\nLev Kuleshov - Proekt inzhenera Prayta AKA The Project of Engineer Prite (1918)\n\nMy rip of the Ruscico DVD\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16e10476b3a9593a1223bed9ae5f1ec923ce72ad","amp;dn":"Lev+Kuleshov+-+Proekt+inzhenera+Prayta+AKA+The+Project+of+Engine","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16e10476b3a9593a1223bed9ae5f1ec923ce72ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,225,4,118,179,169,89,58,18,35,190,217,174,95,30,201,35,206,114,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
