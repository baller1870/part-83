Produced in Germany during a stable period of the Weimar Republic, Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia and makes use of this context to explore the social crisis between workers and owners in capitalism. The film was produced in the Babelsberg Studios by Universum Film A.G. (UFA). The most expensive silent film ever made, it cost approximately 5 million Reichsmark.\n\nMetropolis was cut substantially after its German premiere, and much footage was lost over the passage of successive decades. There have been several efforts to restore it, as well as discoveries of previously lost footage. A 2001 reconstruction of Metropolis, shown at the Berlin Film Festival, was inscribed on UNESCOÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Memory of the World Register in that same year. In 2008, a copy of the film 30 minutes longer than any other known surviving copy was located in Argentina. After a long period of restoration in Germany, the restored film was shown publicly for the first time simultaneously at Berlin and Frankfurt on February 12, 2010.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ac59c6a847760105314a09400f2749f42f6c6fb","amp;dn":"Metropolis+Refound+%28VHS%29+%5B2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ac59c6a847760105314a09400f2749f42f6c6fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,197,156,106,132,119,96,16,83,20,160,148,0,242,116,159,66,246,198,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
