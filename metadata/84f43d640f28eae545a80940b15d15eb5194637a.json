A remix of &quot;News at Ten&quot; (named after the well known ITV news programme), went to No. 45 in July of that year. A third single, a re-recording of &quot;Waiting for the Weekend&quot; which included a horn section, failed to chart. \n\nApart from the three singles, the best known other track is &quot;Sixty Second Interval&quot;. Its ambiguous lyrics have been interpreted alternately as concerning the short cease-fires agreed between armies during wars to allow each to attend to their wounded in the no-man's land between them. The song was the inspiration behind the long running &quot;Sixty Second Interview&quot; feature of the UK's Metro (Associated Metro Limited) free newspaper given away at public transport stations. \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Clear_Days#Track_listing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Clear_Days#Track_listing&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8500kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:02:59\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
