When he comes out of this grisly nightmare Nick panics, persuading his girlfriend, Lori, and their friends, Janet and Hunt, to leave... escaping seconds before Nick's frightening vision becomes a terrible reality. Thinking they've cheated death, the group has a new lease on life, but unfortunately for Nick and Lori, it is only the beginning. As his premonitions continue and the crash survivors begin to die one-by-one--in increasingly gruesome ways--Nick must figure out how to cheat death once and for all before he, too, reaches his final destination. \nGenre: Thriller | Horror \nLanguage: English\n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFilm Length: 1:21:47 \nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1628 kbps\nFramerate: 23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264\nResolution: 720 x 304 \nAspect Ratio: 2.35:1 \nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor QF: 0.310 \nSize of MP4 file: 1.00 GB (1,027 MB / 1,052,392 KB / 1,077,649,671 bytes) \nOriginal Source: CiNEFiLE - 720p\n\nScreen Shots:\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Specifications:\n\nFormat: AAC-LC\nBitrate: AAC = 128 kbps / AAC 5.1 = 300 kbps\nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 / AAC 5.1 = 6 channels\nSample Rate: 48000Hz\nSubtitles: None\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================== &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&lt;/a&gt;\n==================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ce34d4c1d72685f197f4cda6ba35ae212fe146a","amp;dn":"Final+Destination+Boxset+BRRip+%7BMnM-RG+H264%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ce34d4c1d72685f197f4cda6ba35ae212fe146a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,227,77,76,29,114,104,95,25,127,76,218,107,163,90,226,18,254,20,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
