Now, a new generation of marijuana entrepreneurs has emerged across America. They come from the unlikely fields of finance, politics, medicine and law, and they want to claim a stake in this modern day gold rush.\n\nCNBC\\'s \\&quot;Marijuana USA\\&quot; goes inside a flourishing medical pot industry. In Colorado, the demon weed is rebranded as a natural herbal remedy with healing powers that even respectable citizens can enjoy. We meet two restaurant owners who are about to launch a new line of cannabis-infused edibles. And, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll go inside a clinic where marijuana is almost always the doctor\\'s order.\n\nIn this bold new era of greater marijuana acceptance, the business still remains in violation of federal laws. But, the entrepreneurs have asked to be regulated, licensed and taxed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just like any other trade. After more than seventy years as an illegal drug, is it possible that marijuanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s moment has arrived?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                 ****EOD****\n\n                         Even Firefighters need Heroes\n\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57641299faf1d27e97ba0e61a8a3e00354632b56","amp;dn":"CNBC+Marijuana+Inc%3A+Inside+America%5C%27s+Pot+Industry++EoD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57641299faf1d27e97ba0e61a8a3e00354632b56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,100,18,153,250,241,210,126,151,186,14,97,168,163,224,3,84,99,43,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
