Captured by ant-like Selenites,Bedford was anxious to make his escape but Cavor was happy to stay and communicate with the Moon-dwellers. Back on Earth Bedford hears via wireless that Cavor was forced to kill himself and the Moon-dwellers to prevent them from invading Earth. As Jim watches the Apollo landing with his parents back in the present he sees a Selenite,hiding behind a lunar rock,peering at the astronauts.\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img44.imageshack.us/img44/580/vcbwe.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img44.imageshack.us/img44/580/vcbwe.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2129/awkzb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img833.imageshack.us/img833/2129/awkzb.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/5377/8lnhb.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img72.imageshack.us/img72/5377/8lnhb.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a15a450be0368e54dc5ff77d58a4829750a364b4","amp;dn":"The+First+Men+In+The+Moon+2010+DVDRip+XVID-WBZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a15a450be0368e54dc5ff77d58a4829750a364b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,90,69,11,224,54,142,84,220,95,247,125,88,164,130,151,80,163,100,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
