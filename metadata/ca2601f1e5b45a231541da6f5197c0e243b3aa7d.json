If You are an Aerosmith fan you already own every song on here. 'Back In The Saddle' is from Rocks, 'Toys In The Attic' and 'Walk This Way' are both from Toys In The Attic, 'Seasons Of Wither' from Get Your Wings, 'Chip Away The Stone' is from Gems, and 'One Way Street [live]'  is from Aerosmith, but wait its live so you dont own it... yet! This is worth buying just for the live version of 'One Way Street' the studio version is amazing but this is even better! The guitar solo is flawles, and I have seen Aerosmith live 4 times, and heard all of their live albums and they have never sounded better then they do here. It was recored live in '94 at the club MaKIN that Steven Tyler used too own.\n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Back in the saddle [04:41] \n 02.Toys in the attic [03:06] \n 03.Seasons of wither [04:58] \n 04.Walk this way [03:41] \n 05.Chip away the stone [04:01] \n 06.One way street (live) [06:40] \n ____ \n \n 27:07 min \n 38,6 MB \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca2601f1e5b45a231541da6f5197c0e243b3aa7d","amp;dn":"Aerosmith-Made_In_America-%28Retail%29-2001-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca2601f1e5b45a231541da6f5197c0e243b3aa7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,38,1,241,229,180,90,35,21,65,218,111,81,151,192,226,67,179,170,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
