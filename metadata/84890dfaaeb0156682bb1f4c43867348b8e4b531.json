Russell is convinced that Baldwin hasn't got what it takes to remain in the fire department. Baldwin is transferred to a &quot;safe&quot; assignment, assisting arson investigator Robert DeNiro, who is trying to make sense of a series of fires involving an oxygen-induced ball of fire called a backdraft. The investigation reveals a link between corrupt alderman J. T. Walsh and imprisoned pyromaniac Donald Sutherland. The trail of evidence leads Baldwin to suspect that his brother Russell, a much-decorated hero, may be the &quot;inside&quot; man setting up the arsons.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84890dfaaeb0156682bb1f4c43867348b8e4b531","amp;dn":"Backdraft%281991%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84890dfaaeb0156682bb1f4c43867348b8e4b531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,137,13,250,174,176,21,102,130,187,31,76,67,134,115,72,184,228,181,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
