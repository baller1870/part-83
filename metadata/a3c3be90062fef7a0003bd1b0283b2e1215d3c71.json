He had no overarching concept in mind, no absolute agenda, no preset track listing, just the desire to find performers, who, like him, might be eager to step away from defined roles or familiar territory and make a creative leap of faith.\n\nCarlos Santana:\n\nHerbie has an incredible and confident way of playing a melody and improvising the grooves.  More importantly, he is a great and encouraging human being.  He stands for not just some profession in music, he stands for the beauty of the human spirit and what great potential a human being has to create beauty for the rest of the world.\n\nRipped to FLAC using dBpoweramp in Secure Mode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3c3be90062fef7a0003bd1b0283b2e1215d3c71","amp;dn":"HERBIE+HANCOCK+Possibilities+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3c3be90062fef7a0003bd1b0283b2e1215d3c71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,195,190,144,6,47,239,122,0,3,189,27,2,131,178,225,33,93,60,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
