The film examines evidence that ancient    \n         civilizations may have known of this celestial   \n         cycle and that our Sun may indeed display the    \n         characteristics of binary motion.                \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [*] Fullscreen  4:3        [*] English                        \n         [ ] Widescreen 16:9        [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n          [29.970] Framerate         [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n         [576x432 ] Resolution      [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n                                    [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [ ] Other                          \n                                                                       \n                                    [mp3@128kbps 48khz ]               \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [*] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [*] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [914 ] Bitrate                         [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [0] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                  \n                                                                       \n     Enjoy!                                                            \n                                                                       \n       Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: NOVO INSECTS XPDVD XPD SPiCE SMeG THUGLiNE     \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP RAP XPRESS           \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
