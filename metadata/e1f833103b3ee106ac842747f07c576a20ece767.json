Although the product of the same new-generation music technology that figured in the rise of house, trance and techno music, ambient dub's relation to clubland is only marginal. Much of the output is instead anchored in slow, seductive bassy grooves influenced by the studio techniques of 70s' Jamaican reggae producers like King Tubby and Lee Perry. Relaxed and spacious with deep basslines and gently hypnotic loops, dub reinvents the idea of trance music by stretching out the basic components of a track using echo, reverb and delay effects.\n\n1.\tSoft Sitar 12 inch mix  Blackstar Liner\n2.\tRoots Controller  Groove Corporation\n3.\tUnderwater World of Jah Custeau  Original Rockers\n4.\tRelease the Dub original mix Leftfield\n5.\tDe Mat Dubrim  Original Rockers\n6.\tFight the Power 12 inch mix Dreadzone\n7.\tHigher  Code MD\n8.\tStorm in a Bong Bowl  Astralasia\n9.\tDopi  Transglobal Underground\n10.\tSexy Selector  Original Rockers\n11.\tFight the Dub 12 inch mix : Dreadzone\n12.\tStontinki  Space Cadets\n\nThis is compiled from both vinyl and CD\n\nThe needledrops were done with\n\nLinn LP12, Lingo, Ekos and Dynavector XX2 moving coil cartridge, Via  Naim 62 pre-amp into Pioneer PDR-609 CDR, using TDK audio CDR.\n\nArtwork included\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1f833103b3ee106ac842747f07c576a20ece767","amp;dn":"+Beyond+Dub+Dub+From+Beyond","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1f833103b3ee106ac842747f07c576a20ece767","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,248,51,16,59,62,225,6,172,132,39,71,240,124,87,106,32,236,231,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
