It narrates the story of a life which is also the story of a nation--recounting his important accomplishments in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism. The simplicity of his ascetic life of study, work, and struggle is contrasted to the pomp of his official funeral, where the film documents the immense outpouring of grief by the Vietnamese people on the death of their leader. The film's most impacting sequence is its outcry against the Vietnam War, where scenes of anti-war protests in the U.S. and battle scenes give way to disturbing images of mutilated Vietnamese children. This famous section comments on violence by not merely portraying it, but by brutalizing the strips of film themselves, bringing the full force of the horrors of war to the screen in a technique which, in characteristically Santiago Alvarez style, is both highly formalist and emotionally persuasive.[mediarights]\n\n   General\n      Complete name : 79 primaveras.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 333 MiB\n      Duration : 24mn 3s\n      Overall bit rate : 1 934 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 24mn 3s\n      Bit rate : 1 730 Kbps\n      Width : 624 pixels\n      Height : 400 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.560\n      Frame rate : 29.970 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.231\n      Stream size : 298 MiB (89%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 24mn 3s\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 33.0 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 33 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149565/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149565/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpanish audio; multilanguage subpack (English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese)\n\nSantiago Alvarez - 79 primaveras (1969)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c8166d3300d2a929607034c2c88103dc46141c1","amp;dn":"Santiago+Alvarez+-+79+primaveras+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c8166d3300d2a929607034c2c88103dc46141c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,129,102,211,48,13,42,146,150,7,3,76,44,136,16,61,196,97,65,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
