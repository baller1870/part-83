The band recorded three albums and toured throughout the United States during the 1980s. Since then, Heaven has maintained something of a fragmentary existence, with singer Alan Fryer reviving the name from time to time although no new material has been recorded since 1985. The group's original style was similar to that of AC/DC but in later years went in a more commercial heavy metal direction along the lines of Judas Priest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51e09f8f56dbf5575e2d931d224c85527fd1c21","amp;dn":"HEAVEN+%281983%29+Rock+School+%28rare+80%5C%27s+metal+video%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51e09f8f56dbf5575e2d931d224c85527fd1c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,30,9,248,245,109,191,85,117,226,217,49,210,36,200,85,39,253,28,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
