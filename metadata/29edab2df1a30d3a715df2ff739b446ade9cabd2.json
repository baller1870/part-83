Jess and Paul are giving away free diamond cut shredders to shred their credit card bills and other such items unfortunately for the mark there's a scanner inside the shredder and therefore all the information goes straight to the hustlers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29edab2df1a30d3a715df2ff739b446ade9cabd2","amp;dn":"The.Real.Hustle.S09E07.ws.pdtv.xvid-barge.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29edab2df1a30d3a715df2ff739b446ade9cabd2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,237,171,45,241,163,13,58,113,93,242,255,115,155,68,106,222,156,171,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
