All we can say is when you watch his part in High Five, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll be reminded of why he is and always will be one of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most radical surfers.\n\nWade Goodall\nWe canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get enough of his shredding so we sent our camera-dogs after him. When you see some of the stuff heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s got, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gonna hope heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already signed on for High 5 The Sequel. But letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s take it one step at a time here and see why his peers call him one of the best freesurfers on earth.\n\nEric Geiselman\nIf we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say so ourselves, this is EricÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first proper video part. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s one of the first guys to have flips and KerruptÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s on lock, and he bangs out more than his fair share of advanced and impossible-looking tricks. Call this EricÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coming out part(y), even though heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s already been in the game for years.\n\nFergal Smith\nThe Youtube sensation is our dark horse. We basically let him film the whole winter in his own backyard and didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t see any footage until it was all compiled. We were blown away by some of the slabs this knight tames, and you will be too when you see him from the inside and outside of some mean cold north Atlantic drainers.\n\nAndrew Doheny\nIs Andrew aka ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDroidÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next surf superstar? Yes, thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re giving him the opening section of High Five, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s why every surf magazine and filmer is on his nuts right now. In the past youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve only gotten a taste of what this kid is capable of, now youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re gonna see the whole story of a kid transitioning from grom to full-blown man-shredder.\n\n\n*The random black slug during the film is part of the film - NOT an encoding issue.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a80a37a70a6a3649b6943a5071cd62683a803fa","amp;dn":"%5BSURF%5D+High-5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a80a37a70a6a3649b6943a5071cd62683a803fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,128,163,122,112,166,163,100,155,105,67,165,7,28,214,38,131,168,3,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
