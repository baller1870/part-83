He has traveled and performed extensively with these musicians and has documented their backgrounds and musical histories for future generations. He is also a life-long student and devotee of the pioneering performers in the piedmont blues tradition which once thrived in the Carolinas, including such artists as Blind Boy Fuller, Rev. Gary Davis and Elizabeth Cotton; deceased musicians whose influence seems only to grow with time.\n\nHis first solo recording Bull Frog Blues established his blues credentials while his sophomore effort Ragtime Millionaire strengthened his association with the Carolina-piedmont styles of blues. His most recent release Ragged But Right stretches out to explore more facets of American folk music including old-time, country, jazz, ragtime and early popular music as well as piedmont style blues selections.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:446cea015e8146714e271f3e554a2185919987ff","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Lightnin%5C%27+Wells+-+Bull+Frog+Blues","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"446cea015e8146714e271f3e554a2185919987ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,108,234,1,94,129,70,113,78,39,31,62,85,74,33,133,145,153,135,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
