He reasoned that gaining their trust, possibly learning more about their stated crimes or unsolved murders, was a way to distinguish himself as a job candidate.\nHe sends a carefully crafted letter to John Wayne Gacy (William Forsythe) in prison, portraying himself as a vulnerable boy. The film unfolds as Gracy, suspicious at first, puts Moss through intense emotional tests via letters and collect calls, and an eventual face-to-face visit in prison.\nRelease date: May 11, 2010\nFile size: Size\n\n\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1371117/\nGenre: drama thriller\nCast:\n\n# Jesse Moss as Jason Moss\n# William Forsythe as John Wayne Gacy\n# Emma Lahana as Alyssa\n# Patrick Gilmore as Glen Phillips\n# Andrew Airlie as Professor Harris\n# Cole Heppell as Alex Moss\n# Belinda Metz as Valerie\n# Michaela Mann as Autumn\n\n\n\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: mp4(AVC)\nVideo Codec Type: X264\nAverage video bitrate: 2 500 Kbps\nMaximum video bitrate: 14.3 Mbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 740x320\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.422\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: Dear Mr Gacy 2010 720p BluRay x264-aAF Thanks!\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 124 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 kHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels\n\nNOTE\nWe are searching for good encoders.Contact us if you wish to be in our gang!\nWe are always searching for new affliates,dedicated servers and early sources.You are most welcome if you can provide them.\nIf you like our encodes,keep them alive!\nGREETZ: DarkScene,Hawkseye,Noir,SceneUG,TheFalcon007,SUDesigner,HDScene Encoders,,TorrentState,Kingdom RG,MnM-RG,HDLiTE,UKB-KvCD,Movie-Torrentz,AhaShare,Torrent-Force RG,Fastline RG,1337x,Resource RG,ExtraTorrent RG,DDR all SceneUG releasers and Uploaders and all other p2p release groups out there!\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img204.imageshack.us/img204/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img204.imageshack.us/img204/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img513.imageshack.us/img513/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img24.imageshack.us/img24/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/403/deargacyx264hdscenemp4s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f404af38467ba6098afdedb590f0a7731470e568","amp;dn":"Dear+Mr+Gacy+2010+BRrip+X264+AAC+480p+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f404af38467ba6098afdedb590f0a7731470e568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,4,175,56,70,123,166,9,138,253,237,181,144,240,167,115,20,112,229,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
