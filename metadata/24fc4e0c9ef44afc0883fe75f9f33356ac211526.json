It was influential in the development of the zombie genre and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease. The novel was a success and was adapted to film as The Last Man on Earth in 1964, as The Omega Man in 1971, and as I Am Legend in 2007, along with an unofficial direct to video production capitalizing on that film, I Am Omega. It was also the inspiration behind the 1968 film, Night of the Living Dead.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24fc4e0c9ef44afc0883fe75f9f33356ac211526","amp;dn":"Richard+Matheson%5C%27s+I+Am+Legend%28jpg%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24fc4e0c9ef44afc0883fe75f9f33356ac211526","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,252,78,12,158,244,74,252,8,131,254,117,249,243,51,86,172,33,21,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
