Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\n   19 &quot;After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\n   21 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   22 &quot;The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\n   23 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   24 &quot;Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\n   26 &quot;His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.\n\n   28 &quot;'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nI am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...\n\n&quot;This is better...

control panel applet.\n\nThe main feature of Revo Uninstaller is to remove unnecessary files and registry entries left behind by incomplete program uninstallation routines.\n\n\nAvailable editions\n__________________\n\n\nThe product is available in two different editions: A &quot;pro&quot; edition distributed under a shareware licensing model, and a &quot;free&quot; edition distributed as freeware.\n\nThe shareware edition has the following additional features compared to the freeware edition:\n\n  -  Real-Time monitoring of system changes during install of programs.\n\n  -  Forced Uninstall remove remnants of already uninstalled programs.\n\n  -  Multi-level Backup system including full Registry backup.\n\n  -  Print and Print Preview of installed programs.\n\n  -  Export of installed programs in TXT, HTML and MS Excel.\n\n  -  Customizable and flexible User Interface.\n\n  -  Visual themes support.\n\n  -  Full 64-bit compatibility Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.\n\n\nSystem requirements\n___________________\n\n\nHardware requirements call for an Intel Pentium 133 MHz processor or equivalent, 64 MB of RAM, and 5 MB of free hard disk space. Administrator privileges are required.\n\nFor systems where Revo Uninstaller cannot or should not be installed, a portable version is available that can be started directly (e.g. from a USB stick) without requiring an installation and without leaving files or registry entries on the computer.\n\n\nFeatures\n________\n\n\nUninstalling software\n\n\nRevo Uninstaller begins with listing all the installed programs found on the user's computer. If Revo Uninstaller fails to list a particular program, the feature &quot;Hunter Mode&quot; can be used to manually select the program to uninstall.\n\nWhen uninstalling software, Revo Uninstaller prompts the user for which particular &quot;mode&quot; to use, &quot;built-in&quot;, &quot;safe&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot;, or &quot;advanced&quot;. The built-in option simply runs the application's bundled uninstaller. The safe option only removes files which mostly likely can be removed without any impact on system stability and proper functioning. The moderate and advanced modes scan deeper in the registry and folders (directories).\n\nIn case the user wishes to roll back an uninstallation, Revo Uninstaller can create a System Restore point.\n\nNext, Revo Uninstaller runs the program's built-in uninstaller, if possible. Sometimes the built-in uninstaller may be corrupted or missing. In cases when the built-in uninstaller prompts for a reboot after it has completed, it is recommended to cancel the reboot and continue with Revo Uninstaller.\n\nAfter the built-in uninstaller has completed, Revo Uninstaller proceeds to scanning the hard disk for leftover files using algorithms. Users can exclude certain folders (directories), file extensions, and even hard disks from scanning to ensure a critical file is not removed by accident. Once additional scanning has completed, the user is presented with a list of registry entries and files. The user can decide which files to delete or to keep. Revo Uninstaller will prompt if a reboot may be necessary to remove all files completely, as some may still be marked as &quot;in use&quot; (and thus the operating system will not allow them to be deleted).\n\nRevo Uninstaller finishes the uninstallation by offering the user to go back and choose a deeper scanning mode.\n\n\nOther features\n______________\n\n\nRevo Uninstaller also includes several other computer maintenance features:\n\n  -  Junk Files Cleaner: Deletes temporary application files.\n\n  -  Auto Run Manager: Deletes or disables applications which run at startup.\n\n  -  Browsers Cleaner: Removes Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, and Netscape\n     browsing history and cache.\n\n  -  Windows Cleaner: Clears temporary Windows files.\n\n  -  Evidence Remover: Prevents restoration of deleted files by overwriting free\n     space.\n\n  -  Unrecoverable Delete: Overwrites and then deletes selected files and folders\n     in order to prevent their restoration.\n\n  -  Microsoft Office Cleaner: Clears the recently used file history in Microsoft\n     Office 2000 through 2007.\n\n  -  Windows Tools: Provides shortcuts to commonly used tools in Windows, such as\n     System Restore.\n\n  -  AutoUpdate: Checks for new program builds. It can download and install new\n     versions and display a summary of changes incorporated into the latest\n     version.\n\n\n###################################################################################\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n\n###################################################################################","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b67f88d6976f65bdb3df6ff4f9d0d97f905aab6a","amp;dn":"VS+Revo+Group+-+Revo+Uninstaller+Pro+2.4.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b67f88d6976f65bdb3df6ff4f9d0d97f905aab6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,127,136,214,151,111,101,189,179,223,111,244,249,208,217,127,144,90,171,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
