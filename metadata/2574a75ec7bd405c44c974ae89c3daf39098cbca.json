Their spare collaboration on 900 Miles references a wide swath of folk and jazz, but the nocturnal smokiness of Yarrow's haunted alto and Cappadocia's cello combine for a sound that's slightly outside of the usual music universe. There's some Cowboy Junkies here, a dash of Tuck &amp; Patti there and an overall otherworldliness more akin to a David Lynch movie. Yarrow doesn't just vamp for the whole record though; her range careens from hushed to strident, and she even does a pretty fair PJ Harvey wail (circa 4-Track Demos) on &quot;Linin' Track,&quot; and &quot;Isn't That So?&quot; Meanwhile, Cappadocia often puts down his bow, extracting some funk out of &quot;If I Had My Way,&quot; or leading off &quot;East Virginia&quot; with a little Latin guitar flavor. But the heart of the record is in the ballads, as the duo stretches out with long, dark adagio passages filled with dust and desire. Bethany &amp; Rufus successfully transcend their limited instrumentation, coming up with a debut that gets better and better with each listen.
