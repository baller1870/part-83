Golden Earring is the best known and internationally most succesful rock band to come out of The Netherlands. \n\nFounded in 1961, Golden Earring has been active for nearly 50 years non-stop. The current line-up has been together since 1970, which makes Golden Earring the world's longest surviving rock band, having been formed a year before The Rolling Stones. \n\nIn 1961 in their home town of The Hague by 13-year-old George Kooymans and his 15-year-old neighbour, Rinus Gerritsen, they were originally called The Tornados. The band's first line-up mainly played The Shadows covers. The name was changed to Golden Earrings (the 's' was dropped in 1969) when they discovered that The Tornados was already in use by another group.\n\nGolden Earring's upcoming studio album will be recorded live at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London during spring 2011.\n\nIn the beginning of 1971, &quot;Holy Holy Life&quot; was a Golden Earring single release, which neither song on both sides was ever released on any albums (the B-side song was &quot;Jessica&quot;). &quot;Holy Holy Life&quot; is still played by the band today and was a hit in the Nederlands in February 1971. \n(video does not have any logos)\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Earring#Singles&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Earring#Singles&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAbhgAadi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HAbhgAadi&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HABhlaADi&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/HABhlaADi&lt;/a&gt; \n\n^           ^            ^\nVinyl Single Cover Picture\n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:53\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
