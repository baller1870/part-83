It creates an account of life on a fictional housing estate, told from the perspective of four of Phil's creations. \n\nEach episode follows the fortunes of one of the characters as they negotiate the ups and downs of estate life and battle with authority, ex-wives, old friends, NHS surgeons, record companies, estate busybodies and meals on wheels.\n\nwww.comedy.co.uk Review: This was a rather unique radio comedy, in that it was also available in visual form via the red button (see our video section to watch these TV episodes).\n\nLooking back, the series was quite enjoyable with Phil Cornwell showing superb character skills (each week's character was completely different from the last).\n\n\n\nCast:\nPhil Cornwell\nTony Gardner\nDaisy Haggard\nAbigail Hollick\n\nWriters:\nPhil Cornwell\nAndrew McGibbon\nNick Romero\nJonathan Ruffle\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/the_cornwell_estate/episodes/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/radio/the_cornwell_estate/episodes/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Cornwell Estate - S01 - E01 - Dave Kafka \nThe Cornwell Estate - S01 - E02 - Keith Butler \nThe Cornwell Estate - S01 - E03 - Jasper Lengthe \nThe Cornwell Estate - S01 - E04 - Mike Duggan \n\nThe Cornwell Estate - S02 - E01 - Colin Oberon \nThe Cornwell Estate - S02 - E02 - Jimmy Baker \nThe Cornwell Estate - S02 - E03 - Bob Crevice \nThe Cornwell Estate - S02 - E04 - Hank Zuttermilk \nThe Cornwell Estate - S02 - E05 - Kenny Killigrew \nThe Cornwell Estate - S02 - E05 - Switzerland McNaughtiehorse \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 13mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2278bb069a3987a37c466ad1a5f3f317f2e24ce3","amp;dn":"The+Cornwell+Estate+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2278bb069a3987a37c466ad1a5f3f317f2e24ce3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,120,187,6,154,57,135,163,124,70,106,209,165,243,243,23,242,226,76,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
