Look no further than Martina McBride's White Christmas. It's so completely straight and narrow that the music doesn't even sound country, country-rock, or anything but a very predictable slab of easy-listening pop -- strings and all, safe as milk. McBride's not out to sell anything but the songs, all 10 of them, including such staples as &quot;The Christmas Song,&quot; &quot;Away in a Manger,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas,&quot; and... you get the idea. Deep? Not particularly. Surprising? You be the judge. McBride's not blessed with a terribly distinctive voice, and the arrangements are more faithful to the original versions than swans who mate for life.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nMartina McBride's White Christmas features the singer's countrified versions of holiday classics like the title track, &quot;The Christmas Song,&quot; &quot;Silver Bells,&quot; &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas,&quot; and &quot;Silent Night.&quot; [The 1999 reissue includes new art work and two bonus tracks.] \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcefb50746fa99aed382636140ecb8f53a5a1c34","amp;dn":"Martina+McBride+-+White+Christmas+%5BExtra+tracks%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcefb50746fa99aed382636140ecb8f53a5a1c34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,239,181,7,70,250,153,174,211,130,99,97,64,236,184,245,58,90,28,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
