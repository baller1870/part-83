As a consequence, the market for games has developed in a very modularized way: there are games that let you turn your mind off and relax, games that provide different kinds of challenges, games that focus on socialization. Dawntide incorporates all these elements into a game focused around a world in which the players are the driving element and the builders of a new civilization.\n\nIn Dawntide players can create their own cities, even forming nations with their own army and armada. The game gives them the opportunity to create and enforce their own laws and establish government, as well as it gives other players the opportunity to break those laws and overthrow those governments ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ at their own risk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f17a1b20395e408e5f1e1f362c47490f96368ab","amp;dn":"Dawntide+mmo+game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f17a1b20395e408e5f1e1f362c47490f96368ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,23,161,178,3,149,228,8,229,241,225,243,98,196,116,144,249,99,104,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
