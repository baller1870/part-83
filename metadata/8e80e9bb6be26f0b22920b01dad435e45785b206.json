Most notable is that Roadblock is stated to parallel to B.A. Baracus in size and mechanical aptitude, and Flint is formally an actual officer (First Lieutenant in Army Intelligence) rather than a warrant officer and is specifically used as the officer assigned to arrest the &quot;Renegades&quot;, akin to Colonel Lynch of the A-Team series. Also Lady Jaye is sympathetic to her long time friend Duke and provides covert support to the him and the Renegades as was Captain Charissa Sosa in the A-Team film and AAA in the 1980s TV series.\n\nsynopsis:\n\nThe Joes go on a mission to stop Zartan and his motorcycle gang, the Dreadnoks from terrorizing a small town in Kansas run by COBRA.\n\nIntroducing Characters: Zartan, The Dreadnoks (Buzzer, Ripper, Torch, Monkeywrench and Road Pig) \n\nCast\n\nSeries cast summary: \nCharlie Adler - Cobra Commander, Jumpmaster (ep. 1) Cobra Trooper #1 (ep. 1)\nMichael Bell - Duke's Dad\nClancy Brown - Destro\nNatalia Cigliuti - Scarlett\nDanny Cooksey - Snake Eyes\nGreg Ellis - Breaker, Cobra Ops Supervisor (ep. 3)\nNika Futterman - Lady Jaye, Female Reporter (ep. 1)\nKim Mai Guest - Jinx\nDavid Kaye - Main Title Narrator\nMatthew Yang King - Tunnel Rat, Cobra Trooper #3 (ep. 1)\nAndrew Kishino - Storm Shadow\nLee Majors - General Abernathy\nJason Marsden - Duke[3], Cobra Trooper #2 (ep. 1), Mitchell (ep. 2)\nJim Meskimen - Norton (ep. 2), News Reporter (ep. 2), SWAT MP (ep. 2)\nJohnny Messner - Flint\nKhary Payton - Ripcord, Lead Cobra Trooper (ep. 1)\nKevin Michael Richardson - Roadblock, Major Hidalgo (ep. 1), Cobra Security Trooper (ep. 1), Computer Voice (ep. 3)\nCharlie Schlatter - Doctor Mindbender, Security Chief (ep. 1)\nAndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Sogliuzzo - Major Bludd, Store Manager (ep. 3)\nB.J.
