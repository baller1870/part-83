From the earliest days,       \n         when in 1955 Jim Henson introduced Kermit the Frog          \n         on a late night American TV show called &quot;Sam and            \n         Friends&quot;, through to Sesame Street and then The             \n         Muppet Show and Fraggle Rock his creations have             \n         had a magical, universal appeal.                            \n                                                                     \n           Jim Henson and his team of animators, puppeteers          \n         and storytellers have set such high quality standards       \n         in the world of children's television that today            \n         the Henson name is synonymous with excellence.              \n         This special is a celebration of 30 years of Muppet         \n         achievement.                                                \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                              RIP NOTES                              \n                                                                     \n                                                                     \n           The broadcast history of the Muppets technically          \n         started in May 9, 1955, when Sam and Friends                \n         premiered on WRC-TV, NBC's DC affiliate, now known          \n         as NBC4. You don't need to be a math whiz to realize        \n         that by the mid 80s, they were already 30 years old,        \n         which clearly called for a celebration! This special        \n         gives a pretty good idea of how much actually               \n         happened in those 30 years, how many enduring               \n         characters were introduced, how many classic shows          \n         were produced, how many timeless scenes had already         \n         been presented. Chock full of clips, and with an all-       \n         star cast across several Muppet properties (including       \n         rare appearances from the original Sam and Friends          \n         cast), this is truly a worthy celebration. Even Jim         \n         himself makes a short cameo!                                \n                                                                     \n           There are unfortunately a few brief dropouts of           \n         sound and video due to some capturing issues, but           \n         hopefully this shouldn't take much away from your           \n         enjoyment.                                                  \n                     Enjoy!                                          \n                                                                     \n                                               \n                                             \n                                               \n                    \n                \n                         \n                               \n                                               \n                                                                     \n                              ~HO HO HO~                             \n                                                                    \n                                                              \n                 For the month of December we've decided to     \n                do something special. The FLAiR 2010 advent      \n                 calendar will be celebrating the life and         \n                career of Jim Henson, from humble beginnings      \n               until his untimely death 20 years ago.            \n                                                              \n           Every day until Christmas we will be bringing    \n         you new titles from the archives, including    \n        specials, interviews, documentaries, clips    \n      and behind the scenes footage, from every    \n          type of source available to us. Our goal       \n        is to provide real insight into the vast      \n     output of one of the greatest story-         \n     tellers of the 20th century, and the        \n           many talented performers and enablers      \n      that allowed true Muppet magic to grow.     \n                                                 \n                    Sit back and join us as we go looking      \n                  for the rainbow connection, and remember    \n               to check back daily.
