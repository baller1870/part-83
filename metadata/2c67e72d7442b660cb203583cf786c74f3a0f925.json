Programmers and developers used WS-BPEL 2.0. BPMN 2.0 defines one language for modeling business processes and making them executable on a process engine without the need of conversion.\n\n\n\nTom Baeyens and Joram Barrez, the former leaders of jBPM now working for Alfresco, started the Activiti project to create this superb BPMN 2.0 process engine. Half a year later Activiti 5.0 was released. Activiti is lightweight and has a very clean and open API.\n\n\n\nBig thanks for all the hard work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the ActivitVM\n\nThis is an Ubuntu 10.04 LTS installation running Activiti 5.1.
