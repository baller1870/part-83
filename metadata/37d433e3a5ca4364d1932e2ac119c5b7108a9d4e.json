I think I know what the problem is now, though. Or rather, I know what ONE problem is. You know when youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re traveling by boat, and you see weird strips of light on the ocean floor in multiplayer? That.\n\nAlso needed is visible armor on players and mobs (sheep!), and some tweaks to reduce laggy moving mobs. And bows and arrows.\n\nThere are a couple of new settings for the server:\npvp. True by default. If this is set to false, players canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t hurt other players.\nspawn-monsters. True by default. Set to false to remove all monsters.\nspawn-animals. Also true by default. Set to false to remove all animals.\n\n[edit:]\n\nWow, that broke the game. Hold on while I try to fix stuff.\n\n[edit:]\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve uploaded a new server and a new client, fixing the two major bugs I heard about.\nI had to disable leaves decaying again (sorry!) because it caused infinite loops in certain situations.\n\nKeep me posted, and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll keep fixing!\n\n\n\nStay tuned for updates @ Kaen-Paradise.co.cc\n\n=======================================================\n\nThis is an UPGRADE ONLY RELEASE\n\nREPLACE YOUR BIN FOLDER IN &quot;.minecraft/bin&quot; with this bin folder\nOverwrite all files. Start MineCraft the way you normally do.\n\n\n=======================================================\n\n\nWorks well ONLINE on all FREE &amp; Legit Servers.\n\nReleased by Kaen\n24th Nov 2010\n\nAnd I'm not Kaen, so if you hate this upload, direct your hatred towards Kaen, because I could give less of a shit whether you hated it or not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d433e3a5ca4364d1932e2ac119c5b7108a9d4e","amp;dn":"Kaen%5C%27s+Minecraft+1.2.3+HP+Fix+Update","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d433e3a5ca4364d1932e2ac119c5b7108a9d4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,212,51,227,165,202,67,100,209,147,46,42,193,25,197,183,16,138,157,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
