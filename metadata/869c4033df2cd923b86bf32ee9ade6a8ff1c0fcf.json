Love at First Sting became the most successful album of the band in the USA where it peaked at number 6 on the Billboard 200 chart in 1984 and went triple platinum. The song &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; reached number 25 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the same year, &quot;Still Loving You&quot; reached number 64 on the same chart, number 14 in Germany, number 2 in the French and Swiss Top 50. &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; ranked #31 on VH1's 40 Greatest Metal Songs and &quot;Still Loving You&quot; ranked #22 on VH1's 25 Greatest Power Ballads.\n\nIt was not until 1984 and the release of Love at First Sting that the band finally cemented their status as rock superstars. Propelled by the single &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot;, Love at First Sting climbed the charts and went double platinum in the USA a few months after its release. However, Scorpions did manage to stir up controversy once again with their provocative album cover. This time it was a Helmut Newton photograph of a man kissing a woman while at the same time tattooing her exposed thigh. Some stores deemed the cover too provocative and refused to sell the album. MTV gave the album's videos &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys Running Wild&quot;, &quot;Big City Nights&quot;, and the power ballad &quot;Still Loving You&quot; significant airtime, greatly contributing to the album's success. The channel even supplied Scorpions with the nickname &quot;The Ambassadors of Rock&quot;. The band toured extensively behind Love at First Sting and decided to record and release their second live album, World Wide Live in 1985. Recorded over a year-long world tour and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at #14 in the charts in the US and at #18 in the UK.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_at_First_Sting&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_at_First_Sting&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dacOpaAdp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dacOpaAdp&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x480 (4:3) 29.97fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:04:24\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
