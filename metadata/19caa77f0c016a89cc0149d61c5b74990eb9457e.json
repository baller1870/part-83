If you bought these five games separately, it would cost around $85 but we're letting you set the price!\n\nAll of the games work great on Mac, Windows, and Linux.\n\nWe don't use DRM. When you buy these games, they are yours. Feel free to play them without an internet connection, back them up, and install them on all of your Macs and PCs freely. There is no time-limit on your downloads.\n\nYou can support charity. Choose exactly how your purchase money is divided: Between the game developers, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, or the Child's Play Charity. Also, if you like this deal, a tip to the Humble Bundle itself would be much appreciated!\n\nGames:\n&quot;Braid&quot; by Number None, &quot;Cortex Command&quot; by Data Realms, &quot;Machinarium&quot; by Amanita Design, &quot;Osmos&quot; by Hemisphere Games, and &quot;Revenge of the Titans&quot; by Puppy Games.\n\n\n--\n\nPlease buy this pack on the website above and support the authors. Even a few dollars would help them.\n\n*This torrent is designed as a backup method, so the official download servers aren't as heavily loaded.* I would highly prefer you buy the pack before you download this torrent, but I obviously can not force you to.\n\nPlease support the DRM-free devs by buying the pack on the website above, save their bandwidth by seeding, and enjoy these fun indie games!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19caa77f0c016a89cc0149d61c5b74990eb9457e","amp;dn":"Humble+Indie+Bundle+2+%5BWindows%2FMac%2FLinux%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19caa77f0c016a89cc0149d61c5b74990eb9457e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,202,167,127,12,1,106,137,204,1,73,214,28,91,116,153,14,185,69,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
