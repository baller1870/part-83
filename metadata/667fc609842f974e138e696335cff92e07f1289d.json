Here's what you have to do:\n\nRename &quot;the.fugitive.401.dvdrip.xvid-ositv.sub&quot; into &quot;the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.xvid-ositv.sub&quot; - that's the apparent part with the wrong episode number!\n\nThen also rename &quot;the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.subs-ositv.idx&quot; into &quot;the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.xvid-ositv.idx&quot;! For some reason, when appearing in the usenet, the subtext files always are named with the &quot;sub&quot; in the files, which have to be removed and replaced with the &quot;xvid&quot; part. Of course, all the three files have to be the same name before the dot, otherwise there's no use for the subtext files! When renaming the two files here, I wasn't carefully enough!\n\nNow all should be fixed, there will be no replacement files in this case!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:667fc609842f974e138e696335cff92e07f1289d","amp;dn":"the.fugitive.402.dvdrip.xvid-ositv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"667fc609842f974e138e696335cff92e07f1289d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,127,198,9,132,47,151,78,19,142,105,99,53,207,249,46,7,241,40,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
