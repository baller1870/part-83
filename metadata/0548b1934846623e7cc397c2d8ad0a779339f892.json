James consequently went on to win the bedroom producer prize for best unsigned artist and was interviewed live on air by Dave Pearce about his influences and background in music.\n\nJames first became involved with Urban Sickness Audio in 2009 when he was selected to remix Dark Disco anthem 'Never Enough' by VAHN. The quality of his work along with his desire to produce more material for the label led to the creation of 'Audio Lad' and the release of his debut single, Electro House anthem 'It's All About You' featuring the vocals of Micky P.\nTracklisting :\n\n01.
