It was released in 2003 through Nuclear Blast and reissued in 2006 through Back on Black Records.\n\nThis is the first album on which Infernus was not the main song writer. Instead, the music for this album was composed by bassist King ov Hell and drummer Kvitrafn. The album cover is a depiction of a burning church, but due to the controversy caused by this, some copies of the album feature a picture of the band members instead.\n\nSession Members:\nGaahl - vocals\nInfernus - guitars\nKing ov Hell - bass\nKvitrafn - drums\n\nReleased: 21 July 2003\n\nTrack listing:\n1. &quot;Procreating Satan&quot; - 3:43\n2. &quot;Proclaiming Mercy - Damaging Instinct of Man&quot; - 2:56\n3. &quot;Exit - Through Carved Stones&quot; - 5:46\n4. &quot;Teeth Grinding&quot; - 4:34\n5. &quot;Forces of Satan Storms&quot; - 4:35\n6. &quot;Blod og Minne&quot; (Blood and Memory) -3:27\n7. &quot;Of Ice and Movement&quot; - 6:42\n8. &quot;Domine in Virtute tua Laetabitur Rex&quot; - 0:53\n\nLength: 32:37","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2da64df2dbb6662bbed80d9900a11de7740962ed","amp;dn":"Gorgoroth+-+2003+-+Twilight+of+the+Idols","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2da64df2dbb6662bbed80d9900a11de7740962ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,166,77,242,219,182,102,43,190,216,13,153,0,161,29,231,116,9,98,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
