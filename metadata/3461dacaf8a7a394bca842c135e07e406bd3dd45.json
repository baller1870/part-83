And to fully explain the impact of these toys and games, the children of yesteryear - today's celebrities, authors, actors and journalists - reveal exactly what it was that made them love a particular toy.\n\nFind out how Action Man evolved from the American GI Joe action doll and just how Tomorrow's World inspired his haircut. What was the genesis of Barbie? And who came up with the iconic design of the Raleigh Chopper?\n\nThere's also the chance to learn how a one-time wimp created the world's toughest action figure and how the Vietnam War almost destroyed Britain's Matchbox toy car range.\n\nThe shortlist of 100 toys was selected by a panel of industry experts and the final countdown decided by a Channel 4 online vote.\n\nTV Rip\nxvid 1.2 SMP\n640 x 352 approx 1160 kbps\nmp3 48 khz 128 kbs\n\nEach ep about 15 mins, approx 3 hours in total\n\nOOoops, Ive managed to &quot;double name&quot; the files.\nThis handy &amp; free utility will do the trick &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3461dacaf8a7a394bca842c135e07e406bd3dd45","amp;dn":"100+Greatest+Toys+with+Jonathan+Ross+%28Channel+4+-+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3461dacaf8a7a394bca842c135e07e406bd3dd45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,97,218,202,248,167,163,148,188,168,66,193,53,224,126,64,107,211,221,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
