The film's story revolves around a scientist's struggle to control his creation, an android robot whose programme was upgraded to give it the ability to comprehend and generate human emotions. The plan backfires as the robot falls in love with the scientist's fiancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©e and is further manipulated to bring destruction to the world when it lands in the hands of a rivaling scientist. How the robot is stopped from further destruction forms the rest of the plot.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a89de28138ce9062e537812412cb76939f6125a2","amp;dn":"Endhiran+DVD+5.1+Dolby+%26+DTS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a89de28138ce9062e537812412cb76939f6125a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,157,226,129,56,206,144,98,229,55,129,36,18,203,118,147,159,97,37,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
