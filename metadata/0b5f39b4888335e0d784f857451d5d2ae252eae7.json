Being preinstalled on the latest Microsoft operating systems, and also bundled with the most popular productivity packages (Office, etc.) this software installer provides a significant number of power features that improve application management and administration.\n\nThis power doesn't come without pitfalls, and the most important of them all is the complexity. Creating an MSI file requires careful planning and editing of dozens of database tables.\n\nHundreds of pages of documentation must be read, countless lists of rules must be followed. Building a Windows Installer package may take days or even weeks. This is where a MSI creation tool comes to help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b5f39b4888335e0d784f857451d5d2ae252eae7","amp;dn":"Advanced+Installer+7.5.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b5f39b4888335e0d784f857451d5d2ae252eae7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,95,57,180,136,131,53,224,215,132,248,87,69,29,93,42,226,82,234,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
