Bailey has the snap and sound of an old-school folksinger. His lyrics have the polite but reckless fire of Woody Guthrie, while his guitar playing echoes Pete Seeger on a playful day. BaileyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s autobiographical songs make it clear that he comes by his old-school sound honestly, having been there when it was new. But he still sounds fresh; his songs work in any era, and have moved on to deal with the problems of the present as well as the problems of his youth.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/27/fred-bailey/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/27/fred-bailey/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c3717f38c0045bf115fea342551a969a1126f5","amp;dn":"Fred+Bailey...Ain%5C%27t+Comin%5C%27+Back+%28This+Year%29%282002%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c3717f38c0045bf115fea342551a969a1126f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,195,113,127,56,192,4,91,241,21,254,163,66,85,26,150,154,17,38,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
