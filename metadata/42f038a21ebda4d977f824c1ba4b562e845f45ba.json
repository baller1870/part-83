Campbell Bruce.[2]\nIt chronicles the story of Frank Morris (Eastwood) and brothers John (Ward) and Clarence Anglin (Jack Thibeau), who have the distinction of being possibly the only people to ever escape from the Alcatraz prison.\nA cold, atmospheric thriller, the film captures many of the difficulties of prison life and the conditions of Alcatraz prison before it was closed down permanently, shortly after the escape.\nThere is some hint at the end of the film that the escape was successful, but in fact it remains a mystery as to whether the escapees succeeded or not.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42f038a21ebda4d977f824c1ba4b562e845f45ba","amp;dn":"Escape+From+Alcatraz+1979+%7BDual%2BAudio%7D%7BEng%2BHindi%7D+by+Honeyking+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42f038a21ebda4d977f824c1ba4b562e845f45ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,240,56,162,30,189,164,217,119,248,36,193,186,75,86,46,132,95,69,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
