Through DNA testing he discovers the fish in fish and chips may not be quite as advertised and exposes how one major supermarket is misleading consumers about the sustainability of the cod it sells. \n\nThe apparent health benefits of fish have driven demand amongst consumers and made it a lucrative multi-billion pound industry in the UK. But Thomson reveals the chemical additives used in some fish products. He also uncovers that packaged fish on sale in the chilled section of the supermarket may have been frozen for nine months before it's defrosted and sold to consumers - some of whom assume this is fresh.\n \nDispatches goes undercover to investigate the prawn industry in Bangladesh, which supplies Britain with several thousand tonnes of prawns each year, and finds a dangerously unregulated industry. Secret filming reveals serious hygiene issues and the use of a widely banned pesticide to combat disease in prawn ponds. The report also exposes how prawns are injected with a dirty bulking liquid to increase weight - and profit.\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n* Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n* Video Bitrate: 2111 kbps\n* Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n* Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n* Frames Per Second: 25\n* Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n* Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\n* Audio Streams: 2\n* Audio Languages: English\n* RunTime Per Part: 44.Mins\n* Number Of Parts: 1\n* Part Size: 700 MB\n* Encoded by: Harry65\n* Source: DVB-rip (Ch-4 HD)\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d67535461f06543930bb27f9eb042b087fade8e","amp;dn":"Fish+Unwrapped+-+The+Truth+About+Eating+Fish++%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d67535461f06543930bb27f9eb042b087fade8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,103,83,84,97,240,101,67,147,11,178,127,158,176,66,176,135,250,222,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
