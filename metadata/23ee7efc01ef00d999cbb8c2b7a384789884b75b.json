The Lamb family were London born and bred, bohemian and penniless. A combination of poverty and stress drove Mary insane and she committed a shocking crime. Charles saved her from prison and promised he would always take care of her. Mary was never 'sane' again but during the writing of 'The Tales' alongside her brother she was at her sanest. Literary production gave order and structure to her life. The main essence of this play explores the connection between literary creativity and mental equilibrium.\n\nCarlo Gebler is an experienced novelist and playwright. His novels include ' The Eleventh Summer', 'The Cure' and 'How To Murder A Man'. His plays include an Irish version of 'The Dance Of Death', 10 Rounds ( both at The Tricycle London). He has co- written with Brighton bomber Patrick Magee, 'My Father's Watch- The Story Of A Child Prisoner In The 70s' and has taught creative writing in Northern Ireland prisons for many years.\n\nThe leading part of Mary Lamb is played by Lia Williams (Oleanna at The Royal Court, Rosalind in 'As You like It' at the RSC, BAFTA Best Actress for the tv production, 'May 33', 'Earthquakes In London' at The National Theatre).\n\nCharles Lamb is Paul Rhys (films: 'Chaplin' and 'Vincent And Theo' as well as playing Hamlet at The Young Vic, and in Tom Stoppard's 'Invention of Love' at The National Theatre)\n\nThey are supported by a strong cast which includes Anna Carteret ( tvs 'Juliet Bravo' and 'Peak Practice' as well as 'Burnt By Sun', 'Never So Good' etc at The National Theatre), Dudley Sutton ( Ken Russell's 'The Devils', tvs' Lovejoy'), Mark Bazeley ( 'The Special Relationship', 'The Damned United', 'The Queen' (tv/film), 'The Seagull' ( National Theatre) 'Death Of A Salesman' and 'Suddenly Last Summer' (West End), Marcella Riordan ( Sony BBC Radio Best Actress Award ) and distinguished radio rep actors Christine Kavanagh and Sam Dale.\n\nThe drama is directed by Roland Jaquarello, whose work includes periods as Senior Producer Radio Drama, BBC Northern Ireland, Director at The Abbey Theatre Dublin, Artistic Director, Redgrave Theatre Farnham and Artistic Director, Lyric Theatre Belfast.Source: BBC Radio 2\n\n\n\nCAST\n\nCharles Lamb .....
