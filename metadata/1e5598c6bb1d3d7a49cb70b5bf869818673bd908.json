She mostly does have a good voice, it's raw and emotional most of the time. The problem for me was that the songs were generally very 'poppy' and lacking the feeling and emotion that I like to hear. They are upbeat for the most part and if you're looking for folk-pop then this is probably your thing but to me it lacked substance and none of the melodies were particularly affective. \nOn the other hand,  it is worth buying simply for the song 'Bad Bad Girl'. The track is AMAZING. It's exactly what I wish the rest of the album was like. It's haunting and hypnotic and has the most catching and serious riff. It's very long and sends you into a kind of trance. I love it.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/06/melissa-ferrick/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/06/melissa-ferrick/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5598c6bb1d3d7a49cb70b5bf869818673bd908","amp;dn":"Melissa+Ferrick...The+Other+Side%282004%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5598c6bb1d3d7a49cb70b5bf869818673bd908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,85,152,198,187,29,61,122,73,203,112,181,191,134,152,24,103,59,217,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
