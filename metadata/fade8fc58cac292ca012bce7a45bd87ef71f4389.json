She tries to establish a rhythm through every day routines such as eating, sleeping and washing. We see one of here childhood memories-an Alsatian dog licks a girl's heel and rests its head between her legs- and a dream, in which she is standing naked I a pit which could be a grave. In addition we see a magnified symbolic version of her surroundings, particularly of insects. Shots of windows, doors and mirrors convey a sense of menace and introspection. Thanks to measured performance by Marion van Wijk, superb lighting, black and white photography and well balanced editing. The Ants is a highly compelling and evocative film.&quot;\n\nScreenshots:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?id=385&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://board.freakyflicks.org/viewtopic.php?id=385&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFile info:\nNot my rip/encode, greetings go to the whoever made this available and those who kept sharing it...\n\n    File Size (in bytes) ............................: 441,743,676 bytes\n    Runtime ............................................: 31:06.240\n\n    Video Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n    Frame Size ......................................: 688x528 (AR: 1.303)\n    FPS .................................................: 25.000\n    Video Bitrate ...................................: 1509 kb/s\n    Bits per Pixel ...................................: 0.166 bpp\n    B-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\n    Audio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\n    Sample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\n    Audio Bitrate ...................................: 384 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\n    No. of audio streams .......................: 1\n\n********************************** FREAKYFLICKS ***********************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
