While there, he buys his first guitar and writes his own music, and proposes to Vivian. When they got married, they settled in Tennessee and with a daughter, he supported the family by being a salesman. He discovers a man who can pursue his dreams and ends up getting a record with the boys. Shortly after that, he was on a short tour, promoting his songs, and meets the already famous and beautiful June Carter. Then as they get on the long-term tours with June, the boys, and Jerry Lee Lewis, they have this unspoken relationship that grows. But when June leaves the tour because of his behavior, he was a drug addict. His marriage was also falling apart, and when he sees June years later at an awards show, he forces June to tour with them again...\n\nGeneral:\n\nComplete name                    : Klambake\\Walk The\\Line.avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 2.16 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 15mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 2 272 Kbps\n\nVideo:\n\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L3\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 2h 15mn\nBit rate                         : 1 813 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 576 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 5:4\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStandard                         : PAL\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.182\nStream size                      : 1.72 GiB (80%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.1.2 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n\nAudio:\n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                   : CM (complete main)\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 2h 15mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nBit depth                        : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 435 MiB (20%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 32 ms (0.77 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 256 ms\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df11469239df59a82dcc301b7a5caa4115b57f2","amp;dn":"Walk+The+Line+2005+DVDrip+English+Klam","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df11469239df59a82dcc301b7a5caa4115b57f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,241,20,105,35,157,245,154,130,220,195,1,183,165,202,164,17,91,87,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
