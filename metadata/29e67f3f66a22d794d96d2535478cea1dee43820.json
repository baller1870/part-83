He was supposed by some Renaissance Christians to be the King of the Nine Hells. Asmodeus also is referred to as one of the seven princes of hell. In Binsfeld's classification of demons, each one of these princes represents one of the seven deadly sins (Pride, Lust, Envy, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, and Wrath). Asmodeus is the demon of lust and is therefore responsible for twisting people's sexual desires. It is said that people who fall to Asmodeus' ways will be sentenced to an eternity in the second level of hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e67f3f66a22d794d96d2535478cea1dee43820","amp;dn":"LineAge2+Freya+official+system","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e67f3f66a22d794d96d2535478cea1dee43820","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,230,127,63,102,162,45,121,77,150,210,83,84,120,206,161,222,228,56,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
