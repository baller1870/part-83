The world, as we know it, will end. That is what many people, millions of web sites and international doomsday entrepreneurs predict. Written, produced and directed by award-winning documentarian Cynthia Banks, Apocalypse 2012 presents the leaders, chroniclers, debunkers and the businessmen of this wide-spread certainty of a global cataclysm. \nApocalypse 2012 follows people trying to protect themselves and others from what they believe is coming. Sure weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ve seen a lot of this before. But whatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s different and fascinating about all these predictions is that doomsday fear is moving into the mainstream culture at a remarkable scary pace. Apocalypse 2012 examines why this particular doomsday has become so significant.\n\nLarry Hall, Developer &amp; Survivalist and Marty Heaton, Foreman looking at design plans for survival bunker condominium design plans \nPhoto Credit: Gordon Bowbrick \nDeveloper Larry Hall is converting an Atlas F missile base in Kansas into a heavily-guarded, fully-furnished underground luxury condominium shelter.

According to psychologists, archaeologists and scientists, the idea of an apocalypse reflects and magnifies the turmoil and distress of our uncertain times.\n\nJoyce Newberry &amp; Marnix Wells (British couple) pray with Maya elder Hunbatz Men at Coba, Mexico \nAt the NASA Space Agency, Dr. David Morrison replies to daily emails from people suffering anxiety about December, 2012. What will happen? The mythical planet called Nibiru will crash into earth. Or, solar flares will scorch the earth. Or, the magnetic poles will flip or switch. Worried survivalists are convinced that resulting landslides, volcanoes and tidal waves will cut off power and threaten the food supply. Morrison dismisses these theories but not the people who believe them. Lorne Dawson, Professor of Sociology and Religious Studies at the University of Waterloo, says, ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œwe live in a very apocalyptic culture because (people) want the cathartic experience of watching the few heroic figures struggle to survive the circumstance.ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½ \nWhat are you doing on December 21, 2012?\n\n\nFormat :\tXviD\nFile size:  \t352MiB\nDuration : \t44min\nWidth : \t608 pixels\nHeight : \t352 pixels\nAspect ratio : \t16:9\nFrame rate : \t29.969fps\nAudio: \t\tMP3\nNr. of Files:\t1\n\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41cdc1300b1c70ad17258371b7a761f9d70d303c","amp;dn":"CBC+Doc+Zone+-+Apocalypse+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41cdc1300b1c70ad17258371b7a761f9d70d303c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,205,193,48,11,28,112,173,23,37,131,113,183,167,97,249,215,13,48,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
