Assange is expected to face a hasty extradition process to Sweden. We speak with Glenn Greenwald, constitutional attorney and blogger at Salon.com. Greenwald says, &quot;Whatever you think of WikiLeaks, they've never been charged with a crime, let alone indicted or convicted... They've been essentially removed from the internet... Their funds have been frozen... Leading politicians and media figures have called for their assassination, their murder, to be labeled a terrorist organization. What's really going on here is a war over control of the internet and whether or not the internet can actually serve what a lot of people hoped its ultimate purpose was, which was to allow citizens to band together and democratize the checks on the world's most powerful factions.&quot;\n\n\n- Chief EU Climate Negotiator: WikiLeaks Cables' Account of Copenhagen Manipulation &quot;One-Sided and Selective&quot;\n\nWikileaks is a hot topic at the CancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºn Climate Summit after secret diplomatic cables revealed new details about how the United States manipulated last year's climate talks in Copenhagen.

Speaking outside the U.N. Climate Change Conference in CancÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âºn, McKibben says: &quot;In certain ways, [a U.S. walk-out] would be the best thing that could happen. For 15 years ... the U.S. comes and says, weaken the agreement so Congress can go along. Then Congress does not agree anyway. It has wrecked the whole process time after time after time and now the U.S. is doing it again.&quot;\n\n\n- Nigerian Environmental Activist Nnimmo Bassey Wins Right Livelihood Award\n\nLongtime activist Nnimmo Bassey has been awarded the 2010 Right Livelihood Award for &quot;revealing the full ecological and human horrors of oil production&quot; by multinational corporations in Nigeria and for his leadership in advocating environmental justice and human rights throughout the world.
