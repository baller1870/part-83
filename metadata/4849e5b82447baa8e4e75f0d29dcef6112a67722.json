A suburban family moves to a new neighborhood in Orange County, California with their large yet lovable Great Dane, who has a tendency to wreak havoc in his own oblivious way. But its not all living large for the Duke, who finds that fitting in with his new four-legged friends - and a potential romantic interest - isn't always easy for a super-sized teenage dog. Owen Wilson gives the beloved Great Dane his voice in the film, which also features the voices of Fergie, George Lopez, Emma Stone and Kiefer Sutherland.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4849e5b82447baa8e4e75f0d29dcef6112a67722","amp;dn":"Marmaduke%5B2010%5DDvDrip-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4849e5b82447baa8e4e75f0d29dcef6112a67722","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,73,229,184,36,71,186,168,228,231,95,13,41,220,239,97,18,166,119,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
