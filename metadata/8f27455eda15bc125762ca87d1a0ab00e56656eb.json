This song is featured in Highlander, and also samples the lines &quot;I have something to say: It's better to burn out than to fade away&quot; and &quot;There can be only one&quot;, spoken by actors Clancy Brown (The Kurgan) and Christopher Lambert (Connor MacLeod) respectively. Director Russell Mulcahy states in the DVD commentary that this was his least favourite of the band's songs used in the film because he does not like heavy metal. Brian May also commented (to a Japanese magazine in 1986) that both Mercury and Deacon hated the song. It is one of Queen's heaviest works.\n\n\nPlayback guide for PC: To play this video make sure you have VLC media player (VideoLAN) or SMplayer installed on your PC.\n\n\nDownload VLC Media Player: http://www.videolan.org/\n\nDownload SMPlayer: http://smplayer.sf.net/\n\n\nAnother Quality Torrent Courtesy of Hyperdrive 25.\n\nRemember To Keep Seeding.
