Peart has stated that while Nazi concentration camps of World War II were his primary lyrical motivation, he decided to abstract the lyrics so as to apply to the experiences of atrocity of any similar prison camp scenario.\n\nIt also has to do with singer/bassist Geddy Lee's remembrance of his mother's accounts of the Holocaust, which she survived.\n\nThe song title 'Red Sector A' comes from the name of the NASA launch area at Kennedy Space Center, where the band was granted special permission to view the launch of Columbia on April 12, 1981.\n\nGrace Under Pressure is the tenth studio album by the Canadian rock band Rush, released in 1984. A symbol for the album is the letter &quot;p&quot; above a line with the letter &quot;g&quot; below (p/g).\n\nGrace Under Pressure reached #10 on The Billboard 200 and went Platinum in the United States upon its 1984 release. On the back cover is a band portrait by the photographer Yousuf Karsh. The original vinyl pressing also featured a photo depicting an egg being held in a C-clamp. Also, the cover art was painted by Hugh Syme, a long-time contributor to Rush's music ever since he performed as a guest musician on the song &quot;Tears&quot; from 2112.\n\nDuring the tour supporting their previous album, Signals, the members of Rush began by meeting with producer Terry Brown in Miami, calmly informing him that they wanted to move on. They'd become increasingly unhappy with the sound of the Signals album, and they were also keen to see how they would work with someone other than Brown. Despite their decision to part ways with Brown, Rush decided to include a small tribute to him in the liner notes of Grace Under Pressure, which states, &quot;et toujours notre bon vieil ami ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Broon.&quot; The quote translates to &quot;and always our good old friend.&quot; Following Brown's amicable departure, Rush approached producer Steve Lillywhite to record the album. However, Lillywhite withdrew at the last minute, much to the chagrin of the band members. Rush eventually produced the album themselves, with assistance from Peter Henderson, who had previously worked with Supertramp, Frank Zappa and King Crimson.\n\nRush decided to record the album in the band members' native Canada at Le Studio, deciding on the title &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; for the album. The various current events found in the Toronto Globe &amp; Mail newspaper inspired many of the lyrics on the album, particularly those of &quot;Distant Early Warning,&quot; &quot;Red Lenses&quot; and &quot;Between the Wheels.&quot; After a few months, the mixing stage had begun, and Neil Peart discussed the details of the cover art with Hugh Syme. The band spent up to 14 hours per day in the studio, perfecting the album's dystopian sound.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8932ea0db3ba3eae5700cdd7e4c79c21bbb2cd9","amp;dn":"Rush+-+Red+Sector+A+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8932ea0db3ba3eae5700cdd7e4c79c21bbb2cd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,147,46,160,219,59,163,234,229,112,12,221,126,76,121,194,27,187,44,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
