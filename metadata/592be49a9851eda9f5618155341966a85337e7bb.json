Keep the Faith\n\n\nAmazon Review:\nJust when you resign yourself to the fact that everything's probably been done in the world of holiday albums, a disc like A Joyful Noise comes along. Not that there's exactly anything new about the collection: with the exception of two originals, including the title track, the choices are all classics. But Jo Dee Messina brings a unique charm, warmth, and subtle sexiness to standards like &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; attributes that are often missing from yuletide releases. As a vocalist, Messina could teach today's pop divas a thing or two about how to create memorable vocals without resorting to histrionics. Vince Gill shows up to add even more charm on a duet of &quot;Silver Bells.&quot; The nifty arrangements certainly count for a lot, and something like the haunting harmonica solo on &quot;Let It Snow!&quot; is truly unique to recordings of that particular song. But in the end, it's Messina's wonderful voice, spirit, and personality that make this the finest Christmas release of 2002.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:592be49a9851eda9f5618155341966a85337e7bb","amp;dn":"Jo+Dee+Messina+-+A+Joyful+Noise","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"592be49a9851eda9f5618155341966a85337e7bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,43,228,154,152,81,237,169,245,97,129,85,52,25,102,168,83,55,231,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
