The single Seldom Seen has appeared, among others, on the background of a bottled water TV commercial, if I recall correctly.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Tranquillo (4:12)\n2. Seldom Seen (3:43)\n3. Piper (2:20)\n4. We Will Be There (3:58)\n5. What Would You Do For Me? (3:29)\n6. Enquiries (5:24)\n7. I Don't Expect To Touch The Sky (3:22)\n8. Enterend (4:02)\n9. Song Of Gabriel (4:05)\n10. Interlude (1:29)\n11.
