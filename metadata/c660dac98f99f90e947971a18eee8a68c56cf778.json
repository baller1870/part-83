Probably not DXVA compatible because of the ref frame count (and possibly other factors, for that matter). I assumed L4.1 compatibility would've been enough for DXVA, but it's not. Plays fine with a software decoder such as the one VLC and KMPlayer are using.\n\nOur intrepid adolescent heroes wake up to find their beloved television stolen, and embark on an epic journey across America to recover it, and, who knows, maybe even score. On the way they encounter a murderous smuggler of a deadly virus and his treacherous wife, an FBI agent with a predilection for cavity searches, a couple of rather familiar looking ex-Motley Crue roadies, Mr. Van Dreesen singing &quot;Lesbian Seagull&quot;, a little old lady and of course Mr. Anderson and his trailer. Can the Great Cornholio save the day? Uh-huh. Huh-huh.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c660dac98f99f90e947971a18eee8a68c56cf778","amp;dn":"Beavis+%26+Butt-Head++Do+America+%5BDVDrip-x264-576p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c660dac98f99f90e947971a18eee8a68c56cf778","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,96,218,201,143,153,249,14,148,121,113,161,142,238,138,104,197,108,247,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
