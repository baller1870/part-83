The breezy, gorgeous &quot;Air Guitar&quot; is worth the price of admission, sounding like the best song Macca himself never wrote. &quot;Cartoon Heart&quot; and &quot;Emoticons&quot; are almost as good, with Jason's understated arrangements and string quartet backing, but there are also more upbeat tunes like the biting Elliott Smith-styled pop of &quot;Dear Sally&quot; and the musical melodrama of &quot;Romeo and Juliet Are Drowning&quot; to even things out. While Ben's Jeff Buckley-esque croon can overwhelm a couple of the weaker tunes, and the strings-only &quot;What I Meant To Say&quot; is almost TOO precious, this is a great album. These Londoners are pop classicists who are not ashamed of the Carole King and Joni Mitchell records in their collections. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a521d7eb2ab0e5fc2c626e9d0a30b3d40e022b26","amp;dn":"Ben+%26+Jason...Emoticons%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a521d7eb2ab0e5fc2c626e9d0a30b3d40e022b26","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,33,215,235,42,176,229,252,44,98,110,157,10,48,179,212,14,2,43,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
