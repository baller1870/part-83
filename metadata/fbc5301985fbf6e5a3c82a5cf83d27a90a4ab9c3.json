But who protects your private data from being sent out? Little Snitch does!\nProtect your privacy\n\nAs soon as youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re connected to the Internet, applications can potentially send whatever information they want to wherever they want.\nSometimes they do this for good reason, on your explicit request. But often they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. Little Snitch allows you to intercept these unwanted connection attempts, and lets you decide how to proceed.\nLittle Snitch informs you whenever a program attempts to establish an outgoing Internet connection. You can then choose to allow or deny this connection, or define a rule how to handle similar, future connection attempts. This reliably prevents private data from being sent out without your knowledge. Little Snitch runs inconspicuously in the background and it can also detect network related activity of viruses, trojans and other malware\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nWorks on PowerPC and Intel based Macs running Mac OS X 10.4 or later\n\n--- PLEASE SEED ---\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fbc5301985fbf6e5a3c82a5cf83d27a90a4ab9c3","amp;dn":"Ltttle+Snitch+2.3.4+%2B+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fbc5301985fbf6e5a3c82a5cf83d27a90a4ab9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,197,48,25,133,251,246,229,163,200,42,92,248,61,39,169,10,74,185,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
