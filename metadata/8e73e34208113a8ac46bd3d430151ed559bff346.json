Harry Hamlin stars as Perseus, a mortal who, due to the interference of the mighty god Zeus (Laurence Olivier), finds himself in the city of Joppa, far away from his island home. There, he falls in love with Andromeda (Judi Bowker), an imprisoned princess. To free her, win her hand, and thus half of the kingdom, Perseus solves a riddle, but Joppa's enraged ruler orders Andromeda fed to the Kraken, a towering sea monster that's the last of the powerful Titans. In his quest to save Andromeda, Perseus must endure a series of trials with the help of the winged horse Pegasus and a friendly playwright, Ammon (Burgess Meredith). His ultimate goal is to secure the head of the grotesque Gorgon named Medusa and use it to turn the Kraken into stone, but dangers await, including the hideously deformed Calibos (Neil McCarthy). \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-3910&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-3910&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 01:57:55\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 608x352 1.73:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1534 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,31 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n\nDon't hit and run.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/johnefp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nuse kmplayer for idx files\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e73e34208113a8ac46bd3d430151ed559bff346","amp;dn":"Clash+of+the+Titans+%281981%29+Laurence+Olivier+Eng+multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e73e34208113a8ac46bd3d430151ed559bff346","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,115,227,66,8,17,58,138,196,107,211,212,48,21,30,213,89,191,243,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
