The footage is presented in various levels of completion, from raw motion capture and rough animatics to sequences that are only missing green-screen elements. Once again, the runtime is roughly 68 minutes, but only 45 minutes is new. The rest is there to give context to the individual scenes:\n\n    * Scene 19 - &quot;Stingbat Attack&quot;\n    * Scene 20 - &quot;Pandora Rules&quot;\n    * Scene 21 - &quot;Jake Meets Norm&quot;\n    * Scene 26 - &quot;Jake Sees Decanted Avatars&quot;\n    * Scene 30 - &quot;Norm is a Living God&quot;\n    * Scene 35A - &quot;Breakfast with the Scientists&quot;\n    * Scenes 36A-37 - &quot;You're in My World Now&quot;\n    * Scene 64 - &quot;Grandma's Teylu&quot;\n    * Scene 79 - &quot;Pied Piper&quot;\n    * Scenes 81B-D - &quot;Going to the Mountains&quot;\n    * Scene 81K - &quot;Interspecies Booty Call&quot;\n    * Scene 91 - &quot;Norm's Attitude Improves\n    * Scene 93A-98 - &quot;Learning Montage Section&quot; (Early Cut)\n    * Scene C120A - &quot;We're Buying Time&quot;\n    * Scenes 122-123 - &quot;Hunt Festival&quot;\n    * Scene 131 - &quot;Driving Range&quot;\n    * Scenes 131A-148 - &quot;The Dreamhunt&quot;\n    * Scenes 164-172 - &quot;The Challenge\n    * Scenes 174-178 - &quot;The Drums of War&quot; (Full Version)\n    * Scenes 209-211 - &quot;Escape&quot;\n    * Scene 224A - &quot;The Eye of Eywa&quot;\n    * Scene 232 - &quot;You're a Long Way from Earth&quot;\n    * Scenes 235-236 - &quot;Battle Camp&quot;\n    * Scene 248 - &quot;Kick Some Blue Ass&quot;\n    * Scene 277 - &quot;Wainfleet Kills Norm&quot;\n    * Scene 287 - &quot;Neytiri Kills Wainfleet&quot; (Alternate Wainfleet Death)\n    * Scenes 288-327 - &quot;The Avatars Attack&quot;\n    * Scenes 350-351 - &quot;New Life&quot;\n\n\n\n[color=blue][b]General[/b][/color]\nID: 1\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile size: 680 MB\nRelease Duration: 1h 7mn \nOverall bit rate: 1400 Kbps\n\n\n\n[color=blue][b]Video[/b][/color]\nID: 2\nFormat: AVC\nFormat/Info: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat settings, CABAC: Yes\nFormat settings, Re Frames: 8 frames\nBit rate: 1300 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate: 6610 Kbps\nWidth: 1024 pixels\nHeight: 432 pixels\nFrame rate mode: Constant\nFrame rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding: 2 pass\n\n\n\n[color=blue][b]Audio[/b][/color]\nID: 3\nFormat: AAC\nFormat/Info: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile: LC\nBit rate: 96 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\n\n\n\nSAMPLE: YES \nSUBTITLES: NO\n\n\n\n[color=green][b][u]SCREENS[/color][/b][/u]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img33.imageshack.us/img33/4741/vlcsnap2010120802h22m25.png[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img547.imageshack.us/img547/8009/vlcsnap2010120802h23m08.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapturing Avatar (1:38:26)\nHere's where things get good. Capturing Avatar is a four-part, feature-length &quot;making of&quot; documentary by Laurent Bouzereau that explores every facet of the production, from the germination of Cameron's first ideas for the script all the way through to the film's blockbusting release. In between, you'll see the technological challenges of having to invent an entirely new and innovative motion capture workflow, as well as sequences about the creature and sound design, the casting, the score, etc. My favorite bit was seeing Cameron walk around a bare stage with the digital &quot;camera&quot; that he used to see inside the CGI world, framing shots exactly how he wanted them before sending all the info off for finishing at the WETA Workshop.\n\n\n\n\n[color=blue][b]General[/b][/color]\nID: 1\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile size: 915 MB\nRelease Duration: 1h 38mn \nOverall bit rate: 1299 Kbps\n\n\n\n[color=blue][b]Video[/b][/color]\nID: 2\nFormat: AVC\nFormat/Info: Advanced Video Codec\nFormat settings, CABAC: Yes\nFormat settings, Re Frames: 8 frames\nBit rate: 1200 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate: 8091 Kbps\nWidth: 1024 pixels\nHeight: 576 pixels\nFrame rate mode: Constant\nFrame rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding: 2 pass\n\n\n\n[color=blue][b]Audio[/b][/color]\nID: 3\nFormat: AAC\nFormat/Info: Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile: LC\nBit rate: 96 Kbps\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSample Rate: 48000 Hz\n\n\n\nSAMPLE: YES \nSUBTITLES: NO\n\n\n\n[color=green][b][u]SCREENS[/color][/b][/u]\n\n\n\n[img]http://img153.imageshack.us/img153/5349/vlcsnap2010120802h16m59.png[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2416/vlcsnap2010120802h18m29.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\n[b]Seed n ENJOY....[/b]:)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcaee628cd77a7bbbfb2ecb8766afe88441a88ec","amp;dn":"Avatar+EXTRAS+Filmmakers+Journey+Disc2%28a%29+2009+576p+x264+BRRip+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcaee628cd77a7bbbfb2ecb8766afe88441a88ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,174,230,40,205,119,167,187,191,178,236,184,118,106,254,136,68,26,136,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
