Top experts claim that Haramein's &quot;Unification View&quot; of cosmology is mathematically valid could lead to the &quot;Grand Unified Theory&quot; physicists have been searching for since before Einstein's &quot;E=MC^2&quot;.\nAmazingly, Nassim Haramein's theory of physics unlocks important new understandings into Ancient Sacred Science... adding further proof that the ancient spiritual systems were not superstitious imaginings, but advanced methods used to manipulate and describe Universal Forces.\nI recommend &quot;Crossing the Event Horizon&quot; to everyone with an interest in the convergence of Science and Spirit!\n4 Disks / 6 Hours of Engaging Material - Top Production Value","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ce4eaf62cebccb4f34ed63029a60d44e94961ca","amp;dn":"MUST+SEE%21+Crossing+the+Event+Horizon+-+Scientist+Nassim+Haramein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ce4eaf62cebccb4f34ed63029a60d44e94961ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,228,234,246,44,235,204,180,243,78,214,48,41,166,13,68,233,73,97,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
