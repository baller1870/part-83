Fairly well-shot with a steady cam (and what almost looks like digital zooms after the fact). Picture quality has suffered a bit from one too many VHS generations so it's saturated and lacking in detail. Audio is good although it's a bit distant and lacking in bass.\n\n\nSetlist:\nDeuce\nKing of the night time world\nDo you love me\nCalling Dr. Love\nCold gin\nI stole your love\nShout it out loud\nWatchin' you\nFirehouse\nShock me\nAce's solo\nStrutter\nRock bottom\nGene's solo\nGod of thunder\nPeter's solo\nNew York groove\nLove gun\n100,000 years\nBlack diamond (cut)\nDetroit rock city\nBeth\nRock and roll all nite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:153b7b3bac140346aaaec041f44dd24aefbba5c4","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Pittsburgh%2CPhiladelphia+22-7-1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"153b7b3bac140346aaaec041f44dd24aefbba5c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,59,123,59,172,20,3,70,170,174,192,65,244,77,210,74,239,187,165,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
