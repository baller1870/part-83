With historical documentation, he shows how cultures are created and altered by those in control, always to lead the people like sheep into the next pasture. \n[hour 3]\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cuttingthroughthematrix.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nAlex also talks with meteorologist and astrophysicist Piers Corbyn.
