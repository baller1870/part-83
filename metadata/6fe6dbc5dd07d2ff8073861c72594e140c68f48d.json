You play as a faction leader protecting the barbarian city, \nJorvik, by destroying threatening monsters and completing quests. At the same \ntime, you compete with rival factions to see who will rule the city. Barbarians \nchoose their leaders by fighting to the death!\n\nAs a faction leader, you must deal with rival factions through diplomacy, trade, \nand in time, war. Between battles and raids against other barbarian factions, \nyou build the most powerful faction possible, to withstand your enemies. \nBuilding the power of a faction involves exploring a fantasy world, slaying \ndangerous monsters, solving quests for the city, avoiding deadly traps, and \nplundering loot to share within your faction.\n\nBut in this world, actions actually have consequences, so take care. Annoying \nthe powerful and aggressive Legion of Fear faction will cause them to declare \nwar and destroy you. Ignored orc uprisings in the Black Forest will cause even \nmore trouble. Protect ally covenants that are being raided, because friends \nare hard to come by.\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n-------------------\nWindows Minimum specs:\n  Windows 98/ME/2000/XP/Vista\n  1.2 GHz Pentium 4 (or other equivalent)\n  128MB RAM\n  GeForce 2 (or other equivalent)\n  150MB of hard drive space\n\nWindows Recommended specs:\n  2.0 GHz Pentium 4 (or other equivalent)\n  256MB RAM\n  GeForce 3 or better (or other equivalent)\n\n\n\nInstall Notes:\n..............\n\nSimply extract the self extracting archive to any folder of your choice and click on DepthsOfPeril.exe to start the game.\n\n\nThis game is one of the best and most complex I have ever seen.
