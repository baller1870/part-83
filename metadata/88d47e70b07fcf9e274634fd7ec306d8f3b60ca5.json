Unitarian minister John Sullivan Dwight, editor of Dwight's Journal of Music, created a singing edition based on Cappeau's French text in 1855. In both the French original and in the two familiar English versions of the carol, the text reflects on the birth of Jesus and of mankind's redemption.\n\nJon Secada (born Juan Secada on October 4, 1962) is a Cuban-American singer and songwriter.
