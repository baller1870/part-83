It seems that David's only friend is their champion sheepdog, &quot;Owd Bob&quot;. David tries to honor his grandfather's wishes, but he is soon in trouble with the old man, and leaves to live with Maggie's family... and now Owd Bob has been accused of killing sheep.\n\nThis movie is based on a book of the same name. The first movie was in the late '30s and seems hard to find. If someone has it, please put it up!  Thanks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aadd24c2868758e4bb7ac39fed6337b171e952e6","amp;dn":"Owd+Bob+1997+xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aadd24c2868758e4bb7ac39fed6337b171e952e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,221,36,194,134,135,88,228,187,122,195,159,237,99,55,177,113,233,82,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
