Members of the local Triqui Indian community, fed up with years of conflict and government corruption, are attempting to break away and set up their own mini state, but locals tell Williams that those supporting the movement face extreme violence.\n\nAs the violence continues and the world's attention is focused on the Mexican drugs war, this largely ignored vicious civil war amongst the Triqui Indians is yet another sign that the country is fast spiraling out of control.\n\nSee Also:\nMexico's indigenous conflicts\nMurder in the backwoods\nAttempts to repress peasant uprisings have backfired\n\nAug 5th 2010 | oaxaca &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.economist.com/node/16748952?story_id...+print+edition%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.economist.com/node/16748952?story_id...+print+edition%29&lt;/a&gt;\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSource: http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=134899\nUpped by, geclipse........thanks!\n\n------------ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f591d03018113916810fdbdfd635a52da5f53db","amp;dn":"Unreported+World+%7EMexico%5C%27s+Indian+Rebellion+2010+10+22+Ch+4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f591d03018113916810fdbdfd635a52da5f53db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,89,29,3,1,129,19,145,104,16,253,189,253,99,90,82,218,95,83,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
