But then, in my opinion Mazzacurati has always been unusual among Italian directors, due to his sensitivity and his (very un-Italian) understatement. &quot;The passion&quot; tells the story of a group of assorted people, bound together by the most unlikely (and, in some cases, unfortunate) circumstances, who find themselves busy staging the tale of the passion of Christ on a Good Friday in a Tuscan village, an old tradition that is still alive all over Italy. Among the characters, sometimes bizarre but seldom really improbable, two in particular stand out: an obscure, alternative film director that finds himself in a phase of creative stalemate and an ex thief turned actor (and a very bad one at that; or rather not?).\n\n\nINFO\nCodec: XVID\nBitrate: 822\nResolution: 608x256 \nAudio: ITALIAN - MP3@48000, 128, vbr\nLen: 103mins\nFps: 25.000\nSubs: English\nDisc: 1\nSource: R2 PAL (sample of proof folder)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3bd1cf817cff281d88b084b668cf5c9f37f45b","amp;dn":"The.Passion.2010.DVDRip.XviD-iLG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3bd1cf817cff281d88b084b668cf5c9f37f45b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,59,209,207,129,124,255,40,29,136,176,132,182,104,207,92,159,55,244,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
