But along with its Zune-like looks Bend brings a straightforward but highly useful feature set.\n\nBend supports syntax highlighting for a number of languages and is extensible so you can add more.\n\nSearch is very Safari-like, in that the text fades out to highlight just what you\\'re looking for.\n\nBend provides some great display options, too, but keeps it simple so the focus is on the text. You can integrate Bend into the command line and Windows Explorer.\n\nFeatures aside, Bend also concentrates heavily on speed, using XAML / WPF for hardware-accelerated text rendering. Bend is still in beta so expect a few bugs, but is available now as a free download.\n\nThe download mentioned in the Lifehacker link right here (http://lifehacker.com/5604526/bend-makes-for-better-more-attractive-text-editing-on-windows) no longer works, so I\\'m uploading it here as an easy mirror.\n\nI did not create this program.\n\nPics: http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/bendbig.png &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_bendsyntaxplugins.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_bendsyntaxplugins.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_bendsearch.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/500x_bendsearch.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/bendoptions.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/17/2010/08/bendoptions.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nUnfortunately, there\\'s only one font.  Either that or I haven\\'t found the option.  I give it a 7/10.  It\\'s a great program, but it should have more features and have continued to be implemented.\n\nAll content besides personal review and the download itself is property of Lifehacker and Gawker Media, LLC.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddb14e195bad1f97a592582e10b6aae113f6bc31","amp;dn":"Bend+-+Text+Editor","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddb14e195bad1f97a592582e10b6aae113f6bc31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,177,78,25,91,173,31,151,165,146,88,46,16,182,170,225,19,246,188,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
