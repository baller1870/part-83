Its people depend on meat for survival, meat supplied by the processing plant on the edge of town. Meat is sanctified and precious in Abyrne, eaten with devout solemnity by everyone. A feud smolders between the town's religious and secular powersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½whoever controls the food supply controls everything, and conflict is imminent.\n\nBut a handful of people suspect Abyrne is evil, rotten to its religious heart, and they are prepared to sacrifice everything for the truth. What goes on in the meat processing plant? Where does meat really come from? The townsfolk are hungry. The townsfolk must be fed. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4e01727ecb2febde82cbdcd4f6fbc0b3a6477df","amp;dn":"Meat++-+Joseph+D%5C%27Lacey++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4e01727ecb2febde82cbdcd4f6fbc0b3a6477df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,224,23,39,236,178,254,189,232,44,189,205,79,111,188,11,58,100,119,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
