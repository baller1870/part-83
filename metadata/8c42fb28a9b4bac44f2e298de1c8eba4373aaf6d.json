The Pacific Rim is home to half of the world's active volcanoes and ninety percent of the world's earthquakes, yet nearly 800 million people continue to live within its violent edge.\n\nOur journey begins in New Zealand, a land of volcanoes and earthquakes, where we find a 500-kilometre long slip-strike fault deep under the Pacific Ocean. Geologist Hamish Campbell will take us to the crater of White Island, the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most active volcano.  Then we'll visit the country's southern island with John Youngson, to find out how New ZealandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longest fault-line contributes to the gold industry.\n\nFinally in Japan, viewers will hike up to Mount Fuji ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the iconic peak where science and legend converge, getting up-close and personal with a fault-line witnessing firsthand what itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like to discover new ways of monitoring, and hopefully one day predicting, seismic activity onboard the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most advanced drilling vessels.\n\nAbout The Series\nGeologic Journey II will change the way you look at the world. In each episode, we dive straight into the Earth's mysterious geologic processes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and explore both science and legend as we seek to understand and explain the geologic forces that shape our world, and our lives. With Dr. Nick Eyles of the University of Toronto Scarborough as our guide, this five-part documentary series will reveal the Earth's magnificent power and its breathtaking beauty.\n\nGeologic Journey II takes us to some of our planet's most dangerous and dynamic places, and helps explain how they got that way. From some of the highest mountaintops to the lowest salt plains, and from the center of violent volcanoes to the deep trenches beneath the ocean floor, Geologic Journey II travels with some of the world's most outstanding geologists as they decipher the mysteries of the earth's evolution.\n\nCombining stunning HD pictures and beautiful aerial photography, this series gives the audiences a connection to their surroundings like never before.\n\nGeologic Journey II captures a world being torn apart by the very plates that connect it.\n\nThe series is produced by CBC's Science and Natural History Unit, in co-production with 90th Parallel Productions. Series/Executive Producers Michael Allder and Gordon Henderson.\n\nFile Information\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 419 MiB for 44mn 47s 554ms\nSource            : CBC HD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 169 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 126 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c42fb28a9b4bac44f2e298de1c8eba4373aaf6d","amp;dn":"The+Nature+of+Things.S50E06.P3of5.04.Nov.2010.HDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c42fb28a9b4bac44f2e298de1c8eba4373aaf6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,66,251,40,169,180,186,196,79,46,41,141,225,200,235,164,55,58,175,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
