Requested from AMIBAY.\n\n&quot;I am looking for a registered copy of List Enhanced , a DOS utility by Buerg Software.\nMr. Buerg suddenly died on Jan 2010 so there is no way to actually get it anymore\n\nHere is it's homepage, now gone but saved by web.archive.org: http://web.archive.org/web/200611110...g.com/list.htm\n\nLong shot but if someone here has a copy and willing to sell it, please PM me.
