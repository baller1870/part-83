The &quot;untouchable&quot; heavy this time out is masterminding a series of violent robberies, committed by leather-freak hoods Dean Stockwell and Brigitte Nielsen. Unaccumstomed to this nastiness, Bogomil entreats street-smart Foley to help find the miscreants. But mean-spirited chief of police Lutz (Allen Garfield) will brook no interference from outsiders-especially the profanely insouciant Mr. Foley. \n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d829fa301fa3268ceaf3f2c70815fd02d3e1025","amp;dn":"Beverly+Hills+Cop+2%281987%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d829fa301fa3268ceaf3f2c70815fd02d3e1025","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,130,159,163,1,250,50,104,206,175,63,44,112,129,95,208,45,62,16,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
