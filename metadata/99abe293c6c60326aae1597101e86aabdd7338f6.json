Yet it is one of mankindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most magnificent achievements, its story reaching back beyond historical times.\n\nChina's Great Wall, symbol of the turbulent relationship between China and its northern neighbours, influenced the destiny of the Middle Kingdom in every era. The construction of the Wall claimed countless human lives. It extends across peaks and valleys, torrential rivers and vast steppes.\n\nYet it is more than merely a defense. It is a symbol of a division between cultures. Here, agrarian Chinese society; there, the nomadic culture of the herdsmen of the steppes.\n\nIt is key to our understanding of Chinese history and civilization.\n\nEpisodes:\nPart I: Mongol Invaders\nPart II: Protecting the Dragon\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gruppe5film.de/g5/en/history/china_s_great_wall.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gruppe5film.de/g5/en/history/china_s_great_wall.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.ConspiracyHub Com\n  ____                      _                      _   _       _\n / ___|___  _ __  ___ _ __ (_)_ __ __ _  ___ _   _| | | |_   _| |__\n| |   / _ \\| '_ \\/ __| '_ \\| | '__/ _` |/ __| | | | |_| | | | | '_ \\\n| |__| (_) | | | \\__ \\ |_) | | | | (_| | (__| |_| |  _  | |_| | |_) |\n \\____\\___/|_| |_|___/ .__/|_|_|  \\__,_|\\___|\\__, |_| |_|\\__,_|_.__/\n                     |_|                     |___/\n   ____\n  / ___|___  _ __ ___\n | |   / _ \\| '_ ` _ \\\n | |__| (_) | | | | | |\n(_)____\\___/|_| |_| |_|\n\n\n\nPLEASE KEEP SEEDED TO PASS ON THE MESSAGE.
