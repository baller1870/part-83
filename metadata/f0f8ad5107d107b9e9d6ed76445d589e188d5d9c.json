They play their hit single \\&quot;You\\'re A Risk\\&quot; on 96.5 The Buzz frequently.  They will be opening for night two of \\&quot;The Night the Buzz Stole Christmas\\&quot; in Kansas City on December 8th, 2010.  They will be performing with My Chemical Romance, A Day To Remember and Innerpartysystem.  This is an up and coming band who\\'s single is extremely hard to find, so I\\'m sharing the wealth.  Enjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f8ad5107d107b9e9d6ed76445d589e188d5d9c","amp;dn":"The+Beatiful+Bodies+-+You%5C%27re+A+Risk.mp3+%28128kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f8ad5107d107b9e9d6ed76445d589e188d5d9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,248,173,81,7,209,7,185,233,214,237,118,68,93,88,158,24,141,93,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
