It's a burning question that's on literally nobody's mind, and we give you all the answers in this brand new, incredibly cheerful Top Gear DVD Embarking on a terrifying journey into the future, we show you how to drive to work in the perpetual darkness of a Nuclear Winter, how to make motorsport exciting when there's only two racing drivers left alive, and, in a world where all cars are bristling with weapons, how to survive the savage, explosive fury of a Doomsday M.O.T test. \n\nAnd amongst all the nuclear carnage, we also tackle the ultimate petrolhead's dilemma. What cars would you take for a final drive if there was only one barrel of petrol left on the planet? The explosions are huge, the cars are superb, so relax and enjoy.\n\nPS. This frightening vision of a post-nuclear world is backed up by top scientists, in case you think it's us just cocking about. James May &amp; Richard Hammond.\n\n Brand New for 2010 Never seen on TV!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff8396ebcdb2a341a050704eb28ccdcae4b73954","amp;dn":"Top+Gear+Apocalypse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff8396ebcdb2a341a050704eb28ccdcae4b73954","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,131,150,235,205,178,163,65,160,80,112,78,178,140,205,202,228,183,57,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
