This past week the team released a new mosaic of the Moon's near side taken entirely with wide-angle frames. Acquired during a two-week period in December, the 1,300 black-and-white frames create a full-disk mosaic measuring 24,000 pixels across. Gulp!\n\n&quot;As the Moon rotated under LRO's orbit,&quot; explains LROC team leader Mark Robinson (Arizona State University), &quot;the ground track progressed from east to west (right to left in this mosaic).&quot; The image run was timed to keep the Sun high up in the lunar sky but not straight overhead (its altitude varied from 69Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° to 82Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°). This created enough shadowing to define crater rims and other topography crisply, unlike the shadow-free view that we see during a full Moon. The combined image shows slight banding where the 1,024-pixel-wide swaths were stitched together.\n\nread more at http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/116932598.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ee4e8bd3d60b5db02b865b8644b636a5f305154","amp;dn":"24+000+Mosaic+Full+Moon+View+from+NASA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ee4e8bd3d60b5db02b865b8644b636a5f305154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,228,232,189,61,96,181,219,2,184,101,184,100,75,99,106,95,48,81,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
