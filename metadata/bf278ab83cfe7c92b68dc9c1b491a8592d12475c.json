Filmed on location at some lonely piece of coastline in East Anglia &quot;A Warning to the Curious&quot; is based on one of respected ghost story author M R James stories. It concerns a legend regarding three buried crowns of angle-sea. The main character goes searching for one of these (hes a historian or something) and wakes up the nasty (and very scary) ghoul of William Ager the crowns protector. Cue very sinister yet never obvious happenings and a creepy ending. This is part of a superb series of MR James ghost stories serialized by the BBC and is well worth seeking out.\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217142/ \n\nAny.Human.Heart.S01E01.H264[352p.quark].mp4\t298.4 MB\nAny.Human.Heart.S01E02.H264[352p.quark].mp4\t259.8 MB\nAny.Human.Heart.S01E03.H264[352p.quark].mp4\t277.3 MB\nAny.Human.Heart.S01E04.H264[352p.quark].mp4\t261.8 MB\n\n---Drama series which follows the life of Logan Mountstuart which spans every decade \nof the 20th century.
