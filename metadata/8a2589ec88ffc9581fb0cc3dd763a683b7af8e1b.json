When saving data, the operating system scatters it all over the hard disk and this slows down the time needed for accessing files. To make sure you have the fastest access times possible, keep the data on your disks arranged in perfect order. O&amp;O Defrag merges the individual fragments from files and then sorts all data into separate zones. To accomplish this, O&amp;O Defrag gives you three new methods of defragmentation that combine perfectly with all its standard options. Altogether, they allow you to customize the way files are organized on your computer.Your system will start faster, running programs will be speeded up, and new fragmentation can be avoided!\nFully automatic defragmentation at your fingertips! The full set of professional options makes O&amp;O Defrag everything a superior system tool should be!\n\nFragmentation can cause your computer to slow down drastically. When saving data, the operating system scatters it all over the hard disk and this slows down the time needed for accessing files. To make sure you have the fastest access times possible, keep the data on your disks arranged in perfect order. Defragmenting with O&amp;O Defrag merges the individual fragments from files and then sorts all data into separate zones. The result is faster system starts, accelerated programs, and the successful prevention of new defragmentation.\nNew features in Version 14\nNavigation in O&amp;O Defrag 14 was designed to coincide with most user scenarios, so almost all important jobs can be performed intuitively. O&amp;O DefragÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new Quick configuration allows you to defragment your comupter right after installation, or, with just a few mouse clicks, schedule to have it done automatically later on. Once setup, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll never have to do anything else about optimizing your hard disks. On top of this, O&amp;O Defrag 14 will let you optimize any make of Solid State Drives (SSD). After optimization, SSDs are able to access data faster and minimize the wear on flash chips.\nData sorted into zones\nSorting drives into zones results in a logical separation of the database into performance- critical and non-critical files. Depending on their designated use and access frequency, files are divided and moved into zones. System and program files that have to be accessed quickly, for example, will be separated from data such as documents and downloads. As a result of separating files based on how often they need to be written, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s possible to intelligently prevent fragmentation from occurring.Thanks to this logical organization of files, system and program starts require less time, successive defragmentation is done significantly faster, and the fragmentation of program files is completely avoided.\nAutomatic defragmentation\nThe new automatic optimization makes manual defragmentation a thing of the past. This feature is enabled by default following installation, and optimizes your disks behind the scenes, without interfering in any way with the functioning of your computer. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more, O&amp;O Defrag can be set to run a defragmentation as soon as a certain level of fragmentation is reached on a hard disk or partition. Defragmentation can also be scheduled for a certain days of the week, or whenever your screensaver is being used. You can pause and resume defragmentation whenever you want because O&amp;O Defrag automatically recognizes where defragmentation was interrupted.\nPower Management for Netbooks and Notebooks\nThe O&amp;O IntelligentPowerControl technology ensures a special support for mobile systems. As soon as your Internet or notebook is separated from external power resources, O&amp;O Defrag switches to a standby mode and the defragmentation is paused. This guarantees that no battery power is used for defragmentation, and you can finish your work with all available power resources. Once you reconnect your notebook, the defragmentation will be automatically resumed.\nMade in Germany. Made in Berlin.\nAll O&amp;O product are developed and serviced in Berlin.
