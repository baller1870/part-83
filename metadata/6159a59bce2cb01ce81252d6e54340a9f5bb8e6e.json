Billy Conway (Morphine, Twinemen) produced. Tom Dube (Richard Thompson) engineered. Featuring 12 original tunes, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œME &amp; VAN GOGHÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a return to an earlier, more innocent format (Rick Berlin - piano/voice). Simple, skeletal portraiture. The Song Itself - unadorned.\n\nAs true as a torn pocket (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBuddhaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). As confused as a kid stuck in jail (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA LetterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). As sad as a beautiful girl alone on a street corner, her heart + loss a thousand miles away (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Talk About JoanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). Absurd as a leering drunk with a beer gut (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBeer BellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), or a drive past midnight to nowhere (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe RideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Berlin creates a world, a town, a topography that seems as familiar as it is unusual. If Van Gogh was alive + wrote songs, they might sound like this album (the title track: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMe &amp; Van GoghÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).\n\nThe songs:\n1) Me &amp; Van Gogh\n2) Criminal\n3) Slut\n4) Buddha\n5) DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Talk About Joan\n6) The Ride\n7) Party Dress\n8) A Letter\n9) Beer Belly\n10) Last Man Standing\n11) Rock &amp; Roll Romance\n12) Do You Still Love Me?\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6159a59bce2cb01ce81252d6e54340a9f5bb8e6e","amp;dn":"Rick+Berlin...Me+and+Van+Gogh%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6159a59bce2cb01ce81252d6e54340a9f5bb8e6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,89,165,155,206,44,176,28,232,18,82,214,229,67,64,169,245,187,142,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
