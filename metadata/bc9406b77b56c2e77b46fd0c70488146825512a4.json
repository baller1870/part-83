Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 / v18.1.0.37\n2. 180 days / 88 years (the exact number depends on your system and situation). \n3. No need to create a fake Norton Account to get rid of the nag.\n4. Should work for all Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.x releases.\n5. No need to uninstall the crack, as there's nothing to uninstall. \n6. The Norton Subscription Status shows full licensed status. \n \n** The included NTRs are only for and tested on:\n1. - Norton AntiVirus 2011 v18.5.0.125 / v18.1.0.37 \n   - Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 / v18.1.0.37\n2. 120 / 165 days (the exact number depends on your system and situation). \n3. Requires creating a fake Norton account to get rid of the nag (depends on NTR). \n4. May not work with future patches/updates by Symantec.\n5. Requires uninstalling before uninstalling Norton.\n6. The Norton Subscription Status shows Trial status.\n\nConclusion:\n*********** \nBesides the number of days and Norton versions, both the cracks and NTRs give \na fully functional Norton 2011. Not counted is if one of them may fail now or \nin the future, since that may happen to all the cracks and NTRs. So just pick \nthe option(s) which suits you the best, and try your luck !!!\nEitherway, most likely you'll be able to use Norton 2011 till Norton 2012 !!!\n\n\n\n!About Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 by BOX!:\n**********************************************\nNorton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 (NTR2011-v3.2.0) extends the trial period \nof Norton 2011 (NAV + NIS), so there's more time to evaluate the product.\n\nTo extend the trial days, just uninstall the NTR before the subscription \nexpires and install the NTR again for another 120/165 days of subscription\n(the exact number of days depends on your system and situation).\n\nNorton Internet Security has all the same features as Norton AntiVirus, but \nNIS also includes a firewall and offers full internet protection, unlike NAV. \n\n\nNorton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 was tested on:\n*********************************************\n- Norton AntiVirus 2011 v18.5.0.125 \n- Norton Internet Security 2011 v18.5.0.125 \n- Tested on WinXP (x86) and Win7 (x86/x64)\n\n* Norton Trial Reset 2011 v3.2.0 is not for Norton 360 !!!\n* NTR2011-v3.2.0 may not work with future patches/updates.\n\n* File size NTR2011-v3.2.0.exe: 2,23 MB (2.341.584 bytes)\n* Release date NTR2011-v3.2.0.exe: January, 2011\n\n\nNTR 2011 Update Info:\n*********************\nMany users reported that NTR v3.1.3 for Norton 2011 v18.1.0.37 causes problems \nif Norton is updated to v18.5.0.125. If your Norton got locked, expired, or if \nsome of the Norton settings cannot be entered anymore, then try solving the \nproblem by using one of the included NTRs (instructions included).\n\nReported is that NTR v3.0.0 BETA can also be used to unlock and activate Norton \n2011 v18.5.0.125 but the Norton background themes can't be changed and creating a\nNorton account isn't possible (cause NTR v3.0.0 BETA disables the Norton account). \n \n* Note: NTR v3.0.1 was pulled back by BOX!, so don't use NTR v3.0.1 anyway!\n\n\n\n!About the included NIS 2011_Cracks by S&amp;P!:\n********************************************  \nRecently the three (3) included NIS 2011_Cracks were released \nfor Norton Internet Security 2011 by &quot;Shady and Protection (S&amp;P)&quot;.\n\nNIS 2011_Crack v2.0 [180 days] by Shady and Protection (S&amp;P) extends \nthe subscription status of Norton Internet Security 2011 to 180 days.\n\nTo extend the subscription, just run the crack again before the \nsubscription expires to get another 180 days of subscription. \n\nNo need to create a fake Norton Account to get rid of the nag.\n\n\n* Earlier released in january 2010:\n***********************************\n- NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [180 days] by S&amp;P - Size: 341 kB (349.521 bytes)\n- NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [88 years] by S&amp;P - Size: 2,16 MB (2.268.065 bytes)\n\n\nWARNING !!!\n***********\nReported by many users is that both NIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [180 days] and\nNIS 2011_Crack v1.0 [88 years] don't work for long, and that after a few \nhours/days their Norton got locked and/or expired. \n\nIf due to the NIS 2011 cracks by S&amp;P your Norton got locked and/or expired try \nsolving the problem by using one of the included NTRs (instructions included).  \n\nNever heard of &quot;Shady and Protection (S&amp;P)&quot; ??? Then you're not the only one !?! \nFor now it seems like the two other NIS 2011 cracks by S&amp;P are pure WEBSHIT .... \nSo use the two other NIS 2011 cracks and this updated crack by S&amp;P at own risk !\n\n* Reported however is that the updated NIS 2011_Crack v2.0 [180 days] works fine! \nIn that case &quot;Shady and Protection (S&amp;P)&quot; did a real fine job, after having \ncaused many trouble with their two earlier releases of the NIS 2011 crack.\n\nAfter all the trouble maybe &quot;Shady and Protection (S&amp;P)&quot; deserves some credits ...\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n*** When using TPB please read these important notes: \n*****************************************************\n\n01. AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their \n    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're \n    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not \n    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.\n\n02. To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack \n    or folder from being auto-protected &amp; auto-scanned by the AV software.\n\n03. If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored \n    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).\n\n04. To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.sandboxie.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.sandboxie.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4918844/&lt;/a&gt;\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/6091044/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n05. Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.\n\n06. Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies \n    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.\n\n07. Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow \n    connections for lots of apps &amp; MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set \n    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.\n\n08. Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!\n\n09. Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads &amp; seeders in a short time \n    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.\n\n10. Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply \n    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.\n\n11. In general often there are more fake &amp; negative comments than reliable &amp; \n    positive comments.\n\n12. In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.\n\n13. Posting FAKE comments &amp; uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!\n\n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting &quot;TPB's Most Ridiculous Comments&quot;:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=24699&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor visiting my TPB account:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RobbingHood/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis torrent is scanned with:\n1. Norton Internet Security \n2. avast! Pro Antivirus\n3. Kaspersky Antivirus\n\nAlso scanned with some well known antispyware, and tested in Sandboxie.\nMalware detected by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;,\n\nNowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting \nfake comments &amp; files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to \nfrustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less \ndownloadspeed etc etc. \n\nIt's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people \nwho intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files. It's an easy answer against \nthose who intenionally keep posting fake comments &amp; files, which is a never \nending issue. \n\nWhen reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for \none does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app \nand about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! \nLet's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said &amp; posted. \nThings are all up to you, the &quot;United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users&quot;!\n\n\nEnjoy The Pirate Bay\n                                         \n* Status torrent at January 10, 2011 - 12.00 CET: clean, tested &amp; working.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc9406b77b56c2e77b46fd0c70488146825512a4","amp;dn":"Norton+TR2011+v3.2.0+%2B+NIS+2011_Crack+v2.0+%5B180+days%5D+%5BRH%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc9406b77b56c2e77b46fd0c70488146825512a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,148,6,183,123,86,194,231,123,70,253,12,112,72,129,70,130,85,18,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
