Yesterday, I was able to obtain the usual DVD-Rips fresh from the usenet (The Fugitive S04E01-E15 DVDRip by OSiTV). The files are slightly smaller (349 MB), but they are in the avi format and have english subtitles. \n\nBUT: Quality of the mkv-files is better, though (a somewhat sharper picture)!\n\nThere may be people who prefer the avi format, though, so my question: \n\nIs there any interest to switch completely to the avi format (I would start again with episode 4.1, of course!), or do you prefer the mkv format? I would even consider to upload both, depending on your feedback.\n\nI will wait until the end of the week to see what format gets your preference!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a56660a804ad5fe138dd391e9b5b73ef7b18c8a2","amp;dn":"The+Fugitive.S04E06.Joshua%5C%27s+Kingdom.DVDRip.x264.mkv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a56660a804ad5fe138dd391e9b5b73ef7b18c8a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,102,96,168,4,173,95,225,56,221,57,30,155,91,115,239,123,24,200,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
