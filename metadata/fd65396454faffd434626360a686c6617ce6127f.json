Great bluray source\nquality went into this offering!\n\nThe movie is dubbed for the most part of course as it was produced in English\nin most of the speaking parts. \n\nWe used 192k audio for booming sound quality and the video came in at 720 X 392\nAlthough this means little compared to standard DVD cnversions to DivX as bluray\nsource yields a superior picture that will make you feel like you do in fact have\nan HD movie worthy of bluray even! That said, this movie is formatted to play on even standard disc players.\n\nWe hope for no objections to our production of this movie file from the studios\nas we think its only a sample of the 40GB on the bluray disc - on the other hand\nyou only need the huge file sizes if you plan to open your own movie theatre\nunderground perhaps - or a private club even better. Nonetheless, it gives\na good enough reason to seed free of not having a great excuse - this is not \nthe same thing as on the disc as it is only meant for home sized viewing etc.\nSeriously - its nice to have some excuses to offer as to why our versions are \nreasonable enough for all to have without the studios getting mad - we are sharing\na bit of history and culture artifacts for sober reflection as to the best way\nforward in our existance as the best Christianly spirited folk we can be.\n\nWe have included the German srt contained in the mkv orginal file we obtained\nand in addition we have an English SRT of the bluray versions of Der Pianist.\n\nCheers and good luck with the seed! (Danke)\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n \n\n\n \n  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd65396454faffd434626360a686c6617ce6127f","amp;dn":"Der+Pianist+1080p+convert+to+Std+DivX+++%28moviesbyrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd65396454faffd434626360a686c6617ce6127f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,101,57,100,84,250,255,212,52,98,99,96,166,134,198,97,124,230,18,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
