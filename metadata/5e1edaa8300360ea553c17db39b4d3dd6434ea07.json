When this fell through, it was released as a Super8 home movie in 1970. It was first released as a sell-through video in the early 70's in the Cartrivision format, the very first video cassette player / recorder ever marketed. There was also a large rental catalog for this system, mostly of Columbia and Warner Bros. titles. This format was already dead when Betamax and VHS were launched. Almost three decades later this production was released again on home video.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e1edaa8300360ea553c17db39b4d3dd6434ea07","amp;dn":"The+Three+Stooges+-+Kook%5C%27s+Tour+%281970%29+XviD+%5Bbetter+quality%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e1edaa8300360ea553c17db39b4d3dd6434ea07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,30,218,168,48,3,96,234,85,60,23,219,57,180,211,221,100,52,234,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
