See the front cover for an estimated value for these in Mint condition.\n\nThere are a few more that did not made it to this CD ( no more space ) so they will eventually be on a volume two in the future. It is all up to you to comment if that sounds interesting.\n\nFront: http://bayimg.com/MAaAeaAdg\n\nBack: http://bayimg.com/MaAaFAAdG\n\nNote: when you burn this CD ( in Nero ) be sure that the box &quot; normalize all audio files &quot; is checked.\nYou will get an more even level in the tunes that way. ( Some of these old vinyls are low and some are high in sound. )\n\nIf it donÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t show I am seeding thatÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s just because of my IP blocker. Will seed Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´til I see this is going by itself then I delete it from my computer. So keep seeding to keep it alive. \n\nRock on!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f0b62548cafaefc86bc738f16cc1211c37e0ed","amp;dn":"The+rarest+Swedish+Rocknroll+EP%C3%82%C2%B4s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f0b62548cafaefc86bc738f16cc1211c37e0ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,240,182,37,72,202,250,239,200,107,199,56,241,108,193,33,28,55,224,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
