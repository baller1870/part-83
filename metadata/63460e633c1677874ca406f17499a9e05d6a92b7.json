Hansen, formerly a member of Amstrong. However, most of his songs feature ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½guestÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ vocals by Marie-Louise Munck, another Amstrong member. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½#1ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is the first Antenne album and picks up where Amstrong's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½SprinklerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album from 1999 left.\nNo serious trip-hop music can be done anymore (especially after 2000) without being at least one bit experimental. Fortunately, this Danish project invests much into the future, expanding way beyond the initial Bristol sound and onto the outer rims of IDM and ambient, to excellent results. If you are obsessed with sad music, you must check this out.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Here to Go (7:13)\n2. Like Rain (6:46)\n3. Let Me Ride It (6:29)\n4. Whispering (9:37)\n5.
