The man who was the personal bÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âªte noir of FranÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ois Truffaut (when a critic on the Cahiers du cinÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ma) is better known for this overly theatrical, garishly kitsch adaptation of a Victor Hugo novel than for the dozen or so films he made in the preceding decade which showed real directorial talent. Suffice it to say that Notre Dame de Paris a.k.a. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is not Jean DelannoyÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s finest hour ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a plodding, characterless piece of spectacle, entertaining in its way, but by no means a masterpiece. The only great moments in this film are the scenes where Anthony Quinn ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ heavily made up to the point of being unrecognisable ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ succeeds in evoking sympathy from Gina Lollobrigida (who is unconvincing in just about every other scene). ThereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s a raw pathos in QuinnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s portrayal of Quasimodo which is genuinely moving and which prevents the film from being totally emotionally arid. For the most part, however, this feels like a clumsy (yet still watchable) re-interpretation of the Hollywood monster film, scripted and directed with no real enthusiasm, and lacking most of the poetry and power of HugoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢s novel. Still, the final sequence does brings a lump to the throat...\n\nSynopsis\nParis, 1492. In and around the Catherdral of Notre Dame, the poor folk celebrate the Festival of Fools. One star attraction is Esmeralda, a beautiful gypsy girl who enchants all with her dancing and singing. One of her unseen admirers is Frollo, a respected judge and part-time alchemist. He lives within the walls of the Cathedral with Quasimodo, an object of fear and ridicule because of his misshapen body and hideously disfigured face. Consumed by his uncontrollable lust for Esmeralda, Frollo instructs the hunchback to kidnap her. She is rescued by a guard, Phoebus, with whom she falls in love. When the two next meet, Phoebus is stabbed in the back by Frollo. The obvious culprit for the crime, Esmeralda is arrested and sentenced to be hung. At the last moment, Quasimodo rescues her and takes her into the Cathedral, the one place where her persecutors cannot reach her. Or so it would seemÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦\n\nCredits\n\n* Director: Jean Delannoy\n* script: Jean Aurenche, Jacques PrÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©vert, Ben Hecht, based on the novel by Victor Hugo\n* Photo: Michel Kelber\n* Music: Georges Auric, Angelo Francesco Lavagnino\n* Cast: Gina Lollobrigida (Esmeralda), Anthony Quinn (Quasimodo), Jean Danet (Phoebus), Alain Cuny (Claude Frollo), Robert Hirsch (Gringoire), Danielle Dumont (Fleur de Lys), Philippe Clay (Clopin Trouillefou), Maurice Sarfati (Jehan Frollo), Jean Tissier (Louis XI), Valentine Tessier (Aloyse de Gondelaurier), Jacques Hilling (Charmolue), Jacques Dufilho (Guillaume Rousseau), Roger Blin (Mathias Hungadi), Marianne Oswald (Falourdel), Roland Bailly (Torterue), PiÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ral (Le nain), Camille GuÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©rini (Le prÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©sident du tribunal), Damia (La mendiante)\n* Country: France\n* Language: French\n* Runtime: 115 min\n* Aka: The Hunchback of Notre Dame","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75bf69480baf6aff5f49453394acd05a9e672e65","amp;dn":"French+Film+Collection%28Film+14%29+HUNCHBACK+OF+NOTRE+DAME+%281956%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75bf69480baf6aff5f49453394acd05a9e672e65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,191,105,72,11,175,106,255,95,73,69,51,148,172,208,90,158,103,46,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
