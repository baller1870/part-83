Released under the name of the Tyrone &amp; Elliott Levin 4tet, the group\nlooks forward by reaching back to older sounds, particularly in the case of\ntrombonist Tyrone Hill. You can hear Roswell Rudd's voice in Hill's approach,\nhis gutsy, raw-edged, sometimes abrasive attack and nasal tone favoring\non-the-beat quartertones to a bop-infused aesthetic. The opening Sun Ra tune,\n&quot;We're Living in a Space Age,&quot; is a joy, the trombone and Elliott Levin's tenor\nsaxophone taking the role of the Arkestra's call and response. The other six\nnumbers (each written by members of the quartet) bring out different sides of\nthe band. Levin (who is also an established poet) boasts a unique, individual,\nand sophisticated style that contrasts with Hill's earthier attack. Bassist\nHoward Cooper and drummer Ed Watkins play a secondary role, though the changes\nin tempos and the repetitive rhythms require their impressive talents for the\nproject's success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef4b44dabd84c7f7d4393cd57a93c181dc3dd4d2","amp;dn":"Tyrone+Hill+%26+Elliott+Levin+4tet+-+Soul-Etude+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef4b44dabd84c7f7d4393cd57a93c181dc3dd4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,75,68,218,189,132,199,247,212,57,60,213,122,147,193,129,220,61,212,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
