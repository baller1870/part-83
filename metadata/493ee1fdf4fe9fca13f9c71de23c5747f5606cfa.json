So here's a clean version. Second, a number of bonus tracks on the CDs played too fast, likely due to PAL speedup. See, the TVs run at 25 fps in Europe. So when something is filmed at 24fps, they speed it up to make it fit. So the music is too high in pitch and the singers sound like chipmunks. If I had mastered the CDs with that speedup intact, I would be personally embarrassed. So here are the affected tracks at their correct speed and pitch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:493ee1fdf4fe9fca13f9c71de23c5747f5606cfa","amp;dn":"Moody+Blues+Core+7+SACD+FLAC+Repair+and+Speed+Correction+File","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"493ee1fdf4fe9fca13f9c71de23c5747f5606cfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,62,225,253,244,254,159,202,19,249,199,29,226,60,87,71,245,96,108,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
