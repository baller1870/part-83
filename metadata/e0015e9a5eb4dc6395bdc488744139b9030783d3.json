The first New York Moth event was held in George's living room and the story events quickly spread to larger venues throughout the city, and around the country.\n\nThe Moth has presented more than three thousand stories, and yet it's practically impossible to get a hold of any of them, which is why I am uploading them here.\n\nPlease seed!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0015e9a5eb4dc6395bdc488744139b9030783d3","amp;dn":"Moth+Stories+Vol+I","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0015e9a5eb4dc6395bdc488744139b9030783d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,1,94,154,94,180,220,99,149,189,196,136,116,65,57,185,3,7,131,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
