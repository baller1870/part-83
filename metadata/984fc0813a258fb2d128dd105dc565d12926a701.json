The only religious connotation is a brief .. 'And this is thanks to God / Allah ' ... but the videos themselves are presented mainly in the form of modern science, which should be just as amazing if you donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have any religious beliefs. \n\nThese videos are taken from the Harun Yahya website. \n\nAlthough you can download all these videos from the site, they total to approx. 34 GB, and have various issues, which i feel i have fixed, which makes for a better viewing experience, whilst halving the amount of storage area required (under 18GB total). \n\nI have cropped, and chopped the unnecessary various black borders that appear during each video, as footage sources change. \nThere were many, which had crazy unnecessary high bitrates (higher than HD), which was certainly not appropriate for the quality and resolution of the video. I have reduced the bitrates accordingly. \nI have de-interlaced the video. \n\nMy upload is not the fastest, so i ask you please be patient, as I suspect there will never be lots of seeders at any one time. \n\nVLC Player WILL play all of the videos contained here. \n\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:984fc0813a258fb2d128dd105dc565d12926a701","amp;dn":"Harun+Yahya+-+Science+-+Nature+-+Creation+-+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"984fc0813a258fb2d128dd105dc565d12926a701","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,79,192,129,58,37,143,178,209,40,221,16,93,197,101,209,41,38,167,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
