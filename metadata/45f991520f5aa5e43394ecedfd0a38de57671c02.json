The European leg of the tour featured performances that consisted of just Walters and Reb Beach of Winger fame on acoustic guitars.\n\nWhen asked about this tour Reb Beach answered:\n\n&quot;Jamie Walters was THE funnest tour I ever did. It was just Jamie and I, first class all the way through Europe. Jamie and I became great friends and we wrote the song &quot;You&quot; together. With the exception of Kip Winger, he is probably my favorite person in the world (meaning &quot;male person&quot;).&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45f991520f5aa5e43394ecedfd0a38de57671c02","amp;dn":"Jamie+Walters+-+Jamie+Walters+%281994%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45f991520f5aa5e43394ecedfd0a38de57671c02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,249,145,82,15,90,165,228,51,148,236,237,253,10,56,222,87,103,28,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
