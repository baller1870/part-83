Jimmy had recently moved to the area and was looking for a blues guitarist to form a band. Richard and Jimmy appreciated each other's talents immediately, and soon formed the FARRELL &amp; BLACK band. The group proved to be very successful and went on to record two CD's for Stormy Monday Records, Cataract Jump in 1996 and Black Limousine in 1999.\n\nDuring this period, Richard honed his skills in arranging and songwriting, composing the music and writing the lyrics for eight of the sixteen songs on Cataract Jump and eleven of the fourteen songs on Black Limousine. Richard also put out an impressive solo acoustic CD on Stormy Monday in 1998 entitled Street Songs, Jazzy Tunes &amp; Down Home Blues.\n\n\nWorth downloading for track 19 alone.\n\n\nAnd rasputinho use the MagnetLink for the torrent you\nare having bother with.
