Johnson was apparently recorded upon the recommendation of his friend, harmonica player Peg Leg Sam, who joins him for two numbers here.  Hearing the music on this CD makes me so thankful that Pete Lowry, much like George Mitchell in the same period, was not quite ready to assume that the country blues were dead, for the South Carolinian Henry Johnson was a major musical find, every bit in the class of such stellar country bluesmen first recorded in the LP era as Mance Lipscomb, John Jackson, Shirley Griffith and Bill Williams.\n\nTracklist\n1- Join the Army\n2-Who's Going Home With You\n3- Boogie Baby\n4- Rufe's Impromptu Rag\n5- My Mother's Grave Will Be Found\n6- My Baby's House\n7- Be Glad When You're Dead\n 8- Little Sally Jones\n9- John Henry\n10- Crow Jane\n11- My Dog's Blues\n12- Old Home Town\n13- Sign of the Judgement\n\nHenry Johnson-Guitar,Vocals\nPeg Leg Sam-Harmonica","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2d7cd0e74233fd260303ba3a085448ef9ebeba","amp;dn":"Henry+Johnson+The+Union+County+Flash%21%28blues%29%28mp3%40320%29%5Brogercc%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2d7cd0e74233fd260303ba3a085448ef9ebeba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,45,124,208,231,66,51,253,38,3,3,186,58,8,84,72,239,158,190,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
