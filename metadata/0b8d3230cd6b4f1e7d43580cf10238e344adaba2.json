The name is stylized as ACTION!, however I tend to use Action! Do what you want. This EP was given to me by a mutual friend of the band and me. I'm fairly certain they aren't on the TubesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ yet, but maybe they'll begin to surface after a while. They're very good and pretty unique.\n\n[b]I've included both lossless FLAC and 320kbps MP3 versions of every song, so download whichever folder you prefer.[/b]\n\nPardon me, I've never reviewed music before (If anyone can write something better, please message me or something):\nIt Begins combines lyricless, electronic epics with songs with raw vocals and garageband-esque rock. They are somewhat reminiscent of early White Stripes albums. This EP is guaranteed to take you to another world.\n\nIt Begins EP\n1. The Inventor (And His Noble Sacrifice in the Face of a Dying Star)\n2. Creedence Mouselips\n3. Improv No. 6\n4. In the Mind of the Ice King\n5. The Distant Future\n6. Peach Blossoms\n7. Change\n\nHope you guys enjoy this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b8d3230cd6b4f1e7d43580cf10238e344adaba2","amp;dn":"It+Begins+EP+-+ACTION%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b8d3230cd6b4f1e7d43580cf10238e344adaba2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,141,50,48,205,107,79,30,125,67,88,12,241,2,56,227,68,173,171,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
