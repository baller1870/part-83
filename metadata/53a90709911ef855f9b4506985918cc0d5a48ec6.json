Being unlucky in love, Kassie has decided to have a child using artificial insemination. Wally doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t like this idea, but he isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t capable of admitting to himself, let alone to Kassie, that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in love with her. At KassieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s artificial insemination party, Wally gets very drunk and spies the sperm donorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sample in the bathroom. Wally was way to drunk to know what he did that night, and Kassie has moved away because she doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t feel that New York City is a place to raise a child. Now 7 years later, Kassie has moved back with her son Sebastian. While she is looking to get Roland (the sperm donor) more involved in their lives, Wally canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help but notice the many striking similarities that he and Sebastian share.\n\n\nCast: \nJason Bateman ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Wally Mars\nVictor Pagan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Knit Hat Guy\nJennifer Aniston ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Kassie Larson\nJeff Goldblum ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Leonard\nJuliette Lewis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Debbie\nTodd Louiso ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Artie\nScott Elrod ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Declan\nPatrick Wilson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Roland\nRebecca Naomi Jones ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Party Guest\nKelli Barrett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ RolandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Wife Jessica\nJeremy J.
