Upwardly mobile executive Tim (Paul Rudd) has just landed his company an extremely wealthy Swiss client when his boss, Lance (Bruce Greenwood), invites him to an exclusive, yet unusually mean-spirited dinner party where each of the high-powered executives brings a guest to make fun of. Recognizing that his long-awaited promotion is finally within reach, Tim begins to have second thoughts about participating in the elaborate charade when his longtime girlfriend, Julie (Stephanie Szostak), the successful curator at a local art gallery, voices intense disdain for the idea. The following day, Tim is looking for a way out of the dinner when fate throws the perfect guest right in front of his luxury car. Barry (Steve Carell) is a sweet but dim-witted IRS agent with an unusual hobby: he creates elaborate dioramas featuring stuffed mice. His latest project is \\\\\\&quot;The Last Supper,\\\\\\&quot; and he\\\\\\'s just put the finishing touches on a tiny mouse Jesus to set at the center of the table. Tim knows that Barry is his ticket to a big corner office on the seventh floor, but the closer the party looms, the more he realizes that his bumbling new acquaintance isn\\\\\\'t just an idiot, but also is a magnet for chaos.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b195409f087ddf52c481d240ff414429f1ae85b2","amp;dn":"Dinner+for+Schmucks%282010%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b195409f087ddf52c481d240ff414429f1ae85b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,149,64,159,8,125,223,82,196,129,210,64,255,65,68,41,241,174,133,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
