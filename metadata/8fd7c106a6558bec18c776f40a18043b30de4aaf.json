The good news is you can learn to write native applications for it! \n\nProgramming applications for the iPhone is radically different from writing web applications, but weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll take you through both the high-level concepts and the line-by-line code to understand it. While many tutorials show only fragmentary examples or trivial applications, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll walk through a visual news application that fetches data from a web service and displays it with both custom and stock views. \n\nThis 78 minute screencast covers: \n\n* Conceptual Overview \n* View Controller Basics \n* Callbacks \n* Code: Setup \n* Tab Bar Controller Concepts \n* Code: Tab Bar Controller \n* Navigation Controller Concepts \n* Code: Thumbnail Navigation Controller \n* Code: Web View Controller \n* To Be ContinuedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ \n\niPhone View Controllers Part II \nOur first iPhone View Controllers screencast (Part I) was an instant hit. This screencast completes it and continues the momentum in our new series of iPhone development screencasts. \n\nIn this tutorial youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll become confident using the simple yet powerful table view controller. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn about layout, interaction, workflow, capabilities, and tips for working with tables. \n\nWe go beyond simple usage to show how to use a custom cell that dynamically displays multiline text. And youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re free to use it in your own projects, too! \n\nRotation and modal controllers are explained with a sample project included. Explanation is enhanced by the informative diagrams and motion graphics youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re used to seeing at PeepCode. \n\nWe conclude with a priceless tour of troubleshooting tips that will help you write more reliable applications with much less pain. \n\nThis 57 minute screencast covers: \n\n* Table View Controllers \n* DataSource &amp; Delegate \n* Accessories &amp; Callbacks \n* Reusing Cells \n* Cell Styles \n* Code: Table List Controller \n* Table View Methods \n* Populating the Cell \n* Connecting to the Nib \n* Bonus: KVO for Cell Images \n* Code: Grouped Table Detail Controller \n* Handling Row Selection \n* Using an Enum \n* The Table Footer View \n* Autoresizing \n* Dynamic Height Cells \n* Using a Custom Cell \n* Device Rotation \n* Presenting Modally \n* Troubleshooting \n* Expect Blood \n* Deploy Early \n* Zombies are your Friends \n* Threading Issues \n* Memory &amp; Instruments \n* Non-Events \n* The Unexpected \n* Performance \n* Clang \n\n************ \nUploaders note: If you find this useful, consider buying the screencasts. \n************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8fd7c106a6558bec18c776f40a18043b30de4aaf","amp;dn":"Peepcode+iPhone+View+Controllers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8fd7c106a6558bec18c776f40a18043b30de4aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,215,193,6,166,85,139,236,24,199,118,244,10,24,4,59,48,222,74,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
