How sad.\nIm sure everyone still living in 1961 with\ntheir 13inch b/w monophonic televisions \nappreciates your complete lack of know-\nledge, talent, and effort.\n\nRarring and spreading releases while they \nare still uploading and muxing is fairly \nsimple. All you have to do is lie about \nfinal packed size in all the .rxx headers\nand then patch the .rar with the correct\nsize. There is a slight bit more to it,\nbut anyone can figure out the rest with\nminimlal research and effort. Kinda sad \nit took their second rate coder recruiting \nfrom yet another worthless low quality \ngroup to figure it out. \n\nStill to come\n\nMuxing while uploading using custom shit \ntools.\nWhy certain groups are still using \nx264.exe revisions that are 300+ old.\n\nMake sure you collect all the nfo's\nand you too can start your own \n(1)ClickTasticUnit and get leet sites to\npre shit no one wants on. Stay tuned!\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c698c430f8fa3e3a60997935cefae8dfdf96a6f","amp;dn":"CSI.Miami.S09E08.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c698c430f8fa3e3a60997935cefae8dfdf96a6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,105,140,67,15,143,163,227,166,9,151,147,92,239,174,141,253,249,106,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
