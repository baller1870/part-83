They do some songwriting, \nbut their specialty seems to be a balanced mix of very tasty interpretations \nof early classic rock n' roll, ballads, blues, and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nFor our first CD release in 1990 - the 20th anniversary of Jimi's death \n- we decided it had to be an album of his music , and much to our delight, \nthat album - Electric Hamsterland - was universally acclaimed in the music press. \nWe toured nationally in the Autumn with our friends Doctor Feelgood, and this \ntogether with the awareness the album created helped spring us from the \nSouth-East onto the UK circuit.\n__________\n\n 1 - Purple Haze.\n \n 2 - Voodoo Chile.\n\n 3 - Fire.\n\n 4 - Little Wing.\n \n 5 - Spanish Castle Magic.\n\n 6 - Foxy Lady.\n \n 7 - Stone Free.\n\n 8 - The Wind Cries Mary.\n \n 9 - All Along The Watchtower.\n\n10 - Hey Joe.\n \n11 - Star Spangled Banner.\n__________\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 9.40 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 6s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : (1990) Electric hamsterland\nTrack name                       : Purple Haze\nTrack name/Position              : 1\nPerformer                        : The Hamsters\nWriting library                  : LAME3.92\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nDuration                         : 4mn 6s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nStream size                      : 9.40 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.92\n__________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05bcc8a9045ac6faeeebe5bd3a1d2c68c2bf3c6f","amp;dn":"The+Hamsters%281990%29Electric+Hamsterland%5D%5Bmp3+320kbs%5D%5BICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05bcc8a9045ac6faeeebe5bd3a1d2c68c2bf3c6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,188,200,169,4,90,198,250,238,235,229,189,58,29,44,104,194,191,60,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
