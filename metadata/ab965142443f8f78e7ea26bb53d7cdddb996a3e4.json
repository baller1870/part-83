This film tells the story of the extreme weather of 2010, and explores the science behind why Britain came to a frozen halt.\n\nBritain's roads were in chaos; planes were strewn over runways as airports ground to a halt; thousands of cars were abandoned; trains and passengers froze overnight; ambulance services had their busiest day ever; and lives were lost as a deadly freeze gripped the country.\n\nAll over Britain people suffered inconvenience, hardship and danger. There were heroic rescues, tales of human tragedy and heartwarming stories of survival against the odds.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab965142443f8f78e7ea26bb53d7cdddb996a3e4","amp;dn":"2010+-+The+Year+Britain+Froze++%28Channel+4+-+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab965142443f8f78e7ea26bb53d7cdddb996a3e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,150,81,66,68,63,143,120,231,234,38,187,83,215,205,221,185,150,163,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
