Thanks to translators, you rock!\nNEW Introduced secret tweak TotalFinderDontTweakSidebar, to help folk having this issue.\nFIXED Do not apply &quot;Folders on Top&quot; sorting on the desktop view. This should fix ghost icons on the desktop.\nFIXED Fixed &quot;Go To ...&quot; keyboard shortcuts in Dual Mode (issue).\nIMPROVED Registration Dialog is immune to extraneous whitespace characters.\nIMPROVED In trial mode the window badge shows remaining days.\nREMOVED Removed annoyance dialog which popped after every 10 tab switches. It was a bad idea\n\n\nType in any license details.\n\n\nI have very slow Internet upload speed, so please be patient.\nPlease help continue seeding, cause I don't know how long and can keep this up by my own.\n\nRegards and Thanks,\ncorruptedSoul\nTeam Xsocam\n11/07/2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:402950dcf9744ded731767ec87de01aa0fd23941","amp;dn":"TotalFinder+1.0.1+for+10.6%2B+%5Bk%5C%27d%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"402950dcf9744ded731767ec87de01aa0fd23941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,41,80,220,249,116,77,237,115,23,103,236,135,222,1,170,15,210,57,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
