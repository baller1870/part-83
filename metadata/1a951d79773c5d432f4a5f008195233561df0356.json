So far eleven episodes of season one\nare complete, with two more to be done. \n\nThe reason I have delayed continuing is because I ran into trouble with number eleven. It is the Swedish Tiger episode. Two important problems were evident.\nFirst there was lead-in to the video entitled &quot;London Weekend&quot; which made it longer than the earlier episodes. Second the synchronization between the audio and video was intolerable. My subtitles fit the sound but not the picture. I had to teach myself how to change these two elements.\n\nSo, the subtitles on this listing fit my original videos uploaded in the whole Upstairs, Downstairs - Season 1 - (1971 - 1972) for only one through ten. From here-on I have to create subtitles and revise videos (if necessary). So, number eleven in this file, as-is, fits only the new, revised Swedish Tiger which I am going to up load separately. It will fit the old version if you can adjust it yourself using something like Subtitle Workshop.\n\nAlso, most of the numerous mistakes I made in composing the enclosed subtitle files numbers one through ten are corrected in this upload. Be sure to use only this listing. It is different from all the previous ones.\n\nInformation about the whole series at  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLyrics of the songs at  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.updown.org.uk/sounds/lyrics.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\njgordon20904\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;bbd1dcd4c9dfd4d5898b828b8ffbd8d4d6d8dac8cf95d5decf&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a951d79773c5d432f4a5f008195233561df0356","amp;dn":"Upstairs%2C+Downstairs+subtitle+update+6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a951d79773c5d432f4a5f008195233561df0356","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,149,29,121,119,60,93,67,47,74,95,0,129,149,35,53,97,223,3,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
