Max Powers, has launched Ceres, an Earth-orbiting satellite that uses patented &quot;nanotechnology&quot; to help rescue the increasingly moribund atmosphere surrounding Earth 2066 AD. The two go on a hiking trip, only to discover a mysterious chunk of black, shiny rock, which grows several feet daily. By the time you enter the game, this rock - dubbed Obsidian by the unsuspecting campers - has formed an enormous tower. After a little investigation, you find that Max has been sucked into the tower, and as you approach the nefarious mass, you too are abducted, becoming a prisoner of Obsidian.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e23348658b529a6c1068c9720e9271d1af264e1","amp;dn":"Obsidian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e23348658b529a6c1068c9720e9271d1af264e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,35,52,134,88,181,41,166,193,6,140,151,32,233,39,29,26,242,100,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
