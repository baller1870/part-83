Fresh with their success of their best selling album, The Joshua Tree, the band plays monster gigs. Along the way, the band takes the opportunity in indulge in some special musical activities like playing with BB King and performing \\&quot;I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking\\&quot; with a famous church choir. All the while, concert footage of the band\\'s biggest hits on tour is featured while Bono speaks his mind on the problems of his homeland.\n\nWritten by Kenneth Chisholm (&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;711a12191802191e1d31031e161403025f121e1c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;)\n\n\nMany of the songs performed in Rattle And Hum are altered from their original release, most notably \\&quot;With Or Without You\\&quot;, which contains a whole new verse to end the song, \\&quot;Exit\\&quot;, which includes the chorus from Van Morrison\\'s \\&quot;Gloria\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Bad\\&quot;, which adds verses from the Rolling Stones\\' \\&quot;Ruby Tuesday\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sympathy For The Devil\\&quot;. \n\n\\&quot;All Along the Watchtower\\&quot; was recorded in Justin Herman Plaza in San Francisco in front of what many consider to be the ugliest sculpture in the city. Bono\\'s spraypainted words required a formal apology from the band and were removed within days. \n\nBono was advised to cut his \\&quot;fuck the revolution\\&quot; speech during the instrumental to \\&quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday\\&quot; from the film, as it was claimed that IRA paramilitaries had added Bono to their hit-lists. The outburst, in response to the Enniskillen bombing that killed eleven people and wounded many more, stayed in the film anyway. \n\nBono dislocated his arm by slipping on a wet stage during a concert on this tour. That is why his arm is in a sling during \\&quot;I Still Haven\\'t Found What I\\'m Looking For\\&quot; and \\&quot;Freedom For My People\\&quot;.
