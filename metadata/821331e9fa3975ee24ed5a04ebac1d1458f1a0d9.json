This week, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll give my critics a chance to talk back.\n\nIn the special, I criticized how politicians favor certain businesses with gifts like tax breaks. Alpaca farmers get tax breaks and I argued that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s led to a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbubbleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in alpaca farming.   Some alpaca farmers called me an idiot and a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcloseted bigotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The Alpaca Owners and Breeders Association said they ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œexpect to be given equal time to counteract such irresponsible reporting.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ So, I invited the Alpaca Association to come on the show to tell me what I got wrong.  They cancelled at the last minute. Alpaca owner Theresa Reyes-Stassel showed up... armed with her own alpaca.\n\nWeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also give the critics a chance to defend 3 other programs that were included among my ten ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpromises gone wrongÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, starting with Obamacare.\n\nThen thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cash-for-Clunkers, which was supposed to stimulate the auto industry by spending $2 Billion to destroy perfectly good used cars. Progressives, like Tamara Draut from Demos, still think this was a good idea. She will argue with me and Edmunds.com CEO Jeremy Anwyl.\n\nFinally, in response to my argument that the minimum wage kills jobs, some viewers wrote that I advocated ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œslave wages.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Christian Dorsey from the Economic Policy Institute will appear on the show to argue the merits of minimum wage.  Small business owner Warren Myer will appear to call it a job killer.\n\nThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tonight on FBN at 9pm and Midnight ET.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:821331e9fa3975ee24ed5a04ebac1d1458f1a0d9","amp;dn":"20110120-Stossel-%5BThe+Curse+of+Good+Intentions%5D-Fox+Business.CF.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"821331e9fa3975ee24ed5a04ebac1d1458f1a0d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,19,49,233,250,57,117,238,36,237,90,4,235,172,29,20,88,241,160,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
