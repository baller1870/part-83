While you couldn't say this is an essential release if you're not a garage fan, this is a decent, 30-cut compilation of released and unreleased material from Scotty and its affiliated labels. The Electras in particular have an appealing snarl, best showcased on &quot;Dirty Old Man&quot; and the original, molten-hot version of &quot;Action Woman&quot; (covered by another of Kendrick's acts, the Litter, whose version appears on the Pebbles series). The 11 Electras' tracks are the most interesting portion of this anthology, but most of the rest of it's reasonably satisfying fuzz-Farfisa garage pop by the Scotsmen, the Victors, the Second Edition, Hope, the Paisleys, and White Lightning, sometimes with pop and/or psychedelic edges. The Scotsmen's &quot;Beer Bust Blues&quot; is frat rock at its grossest; fans of the Litter (by far the most famous group on this compilation) will find a previously unreleased cover of &quot;Hey Joe,&quot; as well as a 7 Up commercial. \n\nTracklist:\n01.
