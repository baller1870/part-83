This song is about a transvestite. Also, the song's solo features the use of a talk box by lead guitarist Slash.\n\nIt is the third single from Libertad, after &quot;She Builds Quick Machines&quot; and &quot;The Last Fight&quot;. The band's official website started a poll on which track, out of &quot;Let It Roll&quot;, &quot;She Mine&quot; and &quot;Get Out the Door&quot;, to decide which song should be chosen as to be released as the third single. &quot;Get Out the Door&quot; won with 53.3% of the votes.\n\nBy coincidence, the appropriately titled song was the last song by the band to feature singer Scott Weiland before his departure from the band.\n\nThis music video for &quot;Get Out The Door&quot; was directed by Dean Karr. The Director of Photography for the video was Rocco Guarino. Rocco filmed concert footage of the band and took photos throughout the course of their career, then Dean used this footage to assemble a performance video.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out_the_Door&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out_the_Door&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FABiGaADj&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/FABiGaADj&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 640x360 29.96fps 5106kbps\n   Audio: AAC (Advanced Audio Codec) 44100Hz stereo 152kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:17\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
