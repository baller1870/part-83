All audio should be HQ in 192kbps\n\nRCA Victor\nThe New Broadway Cast Recording\nAnything Goes\n\nA Lincoln Center Theater Recording\n\nOne of the leaders in the trend of big splashy revivals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Lincoln Center's 1987 production of Anything Goes was the perfect evocation of the 1930s, from the period pit band to James McMullan's striking poster art to the large photograph of Cole Porter that smiled over the stage like an approving spirit. While the score earns its share of authenticity by resurrecting numerous songs from the original score, it also tosses in a few ringers such as &quot;Friendship&quot; and &quot;It's De-Lovely.&quot; (Porter himself did not mind when people staging his shows borrowed songs from his other shows.) Then-rising star Howard McGillin sings sweet ballads and the ensemble numbers are excellent, but the show belongs to Patti LuPone, who in the role of Reno Sweeney grabs the baton from Ethel Merman and never lets go. Her &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot; is one of the great performances of her generation, and the title tune and &quot;Blow, Gabriel, Blow&quot; make almost every other song sound like filler. LuPone was upset in the Tony race by Joanna Gleason, but the show did win for Best Revival.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7fc0171f701c289a2d1a875f91d7ec6215a3c3f","amp;dn":"The+New+Broadway+Cast+-+Anything+Goes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7fc0171f701c289a2d1a875f91d7ec6215a3c3f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,252,1,113,247,1,194,137,162,209,168,117,249,29,126,198,33,90,60,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
