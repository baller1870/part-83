He is about to leave Tehran for good to go back to his hometown when he comes across young university student Roya Atabaki (Sahar Jafari-Jozani) who is researching for her final year dissertation, which is regarding the period 1198-1203, that is said to be a period of turmoil for Iran's ruling elite. Such turmoil that, very few books are available on that period for Roya's research. It is then that Nima receives an anonymous telephone call, which leads him to Saadabad Palace (currently a museum), where he is told to have a coffee and wait. The coffee (which is bitter) is ready and he duly drinks it, his sight becomes hazy, and when he manages to refocus he is in the year 1201 (1822 AD), and the story develops therein.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01157c8047a617c13ae26be05d335097e44a271a","amp;dn":"Ghahveye+Talkh+S01E01+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01157c8047a617c13ae26be05d335097e44a271a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,21,124,128,71,166,23,193,58,226,107,224,93,51,80,151,228,74,39,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
