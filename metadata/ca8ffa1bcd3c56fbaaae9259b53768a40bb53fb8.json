Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible-inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.\n\nDESCRIPTION FROM BACK COVER OF DVD FOLDER:\nAcclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan directs an international cast in this sci-fi actioner that travels around the globe and into the world of dreams. Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is the best there is at extraction: stealing valuable secrets inside the subconscious during the mindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s vulnerable dream state. His skill has made him a coveted player in industrial espionage but also has made him a fugitive and cost him dearly. Now he may get a second chance if he can do the impossible: inception, planting an idea rather than stealing one. If they succeed, Cobb and his team could pull off the perfect crime. But no planning or expertise can prepare them for a dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy only Cobb could have seen coming.\n\nCAST:\nInception is a 2010 American science fiction film written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan.\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tLeonardo DiCaprio as Dominick &quot;Dom&quot; Cobb, the Extractor, a professional thief who specializes in conning secrets from his victims by infiltrating their dreams. Cobb leads a team consisting of Arthur, Ariadne, Eames, Saito, and Yusuf, with the goal of influencing Fischer Jr's actions via his dreams. DiCaprio was the first actor to be cast in the film.[12] Nolan had been trying to work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to convince him to appear in any of his films until Inception.[13]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tKen Watanabe as Mr. Saito, the Tourist, a businessman who employs Cobb for the team's mission, and insists on joining them inside.[14]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tJoseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, the Point Man, Cobb's partner who takes &quot;point&quot; during jobs and is responsible for researching the team's targets.\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tMarion Cotillard as Mallorie &quot;Mal&quot; Cobb, the Shade, Dom Cobb's projection of his deceased wife and a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. As the film's main antagonist, she is a manifestation of his guilt about the real Mal's suicide. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.[13]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tEllen Page as Ariadne, the Architect, a graduate student who is recruited to construct the various dreamscapes, which are described as mazes. The name Ariadne alludes to a princess of Greek myth, daughter of King Minos, who aided the hero Theseus by giving him a sword and a ball of string to help him navigate the labyrinth which was the prison of the Minotaur.[15]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tTom Hardy as Eames, the Forger, a sharp-tongued associate of Cobb's. Eames uses his ability to take the form of others in order to manipulate Fischer Jr. in his own dreams.\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tCillian Murphy as Robert Michael Fischer Jr., the Mark, the heir to a business empire and the team's target.[16]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tDileep Rao as Yusuf, the Chemist, who formulates the drugs needed to sustain the dream states.\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tTom Berenger as Peter Browning, Fischer Jr's godfather and fellow executive at the Fischers' company.[1]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tMichael Caine as Prof. Stephen Miles, Cobb's mentor and father-in-law,[17] and Ariadne's college professor who recommends her to the team.[18]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tPete Postlethwaite as Maurice Fischer, Robert's dying father.[17]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tLukas Haas as Nash, an architect in Cobb's employment who is replaced by Ariadne.[19]\nÃƒÂ¯Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â§\tMiranda Nolan plays a minor role as an air hostess. Miranda is a first cousin to the film's director Christopher Nolan.[20\n\nMEMORABLE QUOTES:\nCobb: Never recreate places from your memory. Always imagine new places! \nCobb: [from trailer] Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange. \nProfessor: Mr. Cobb has a job offer he would like to discuss with you. \nAriadne: Like a work placement? \nCobb: Not exactly. \nCobb: [From Trailer] The seed that we planted in this man's mind may change everything. \n\nREVIEWS:\n4 stars! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDazzling. Breathtaking.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n-Roger Ebert\n&quot;A wildly ingenÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ious chess game,&quot; and added &quot;the result is a knockout.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n-Peter Travers, Rolling Stone\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpectacular ActionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n-Caryn James, Newsweek\n\nPLEASE SEED! No LEACHERS! This is nowhere on the net, with all the extras ripped from the DVD. Help get this going! SEED TILL U BLEED! \nCheers, ENJOY! vladtepes3176\n\nTrackers used for this Release.
