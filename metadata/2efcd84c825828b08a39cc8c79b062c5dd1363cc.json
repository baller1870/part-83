Inviting listeners to a virtual reunion of characters from \nthe 1960s (which he loosely defines as the years between 1963 and 1972), \nthis compendium of interviews and anecdotes is loosely held together \nby Brokaw's own biographical time line and opinions. His warm, familiar \nvoice is still filled with genuine curiosity, which listeners will find \nhard to resist. On audio, Brokaw's diction becomes a little rough around \nthe edges, occasionally letting words run together. Brokaw, who has \nbeen a guest in our living rooms for as long as many people can remember, \nis still welcome to report on the world as he sees it.\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. \nAll rights reserved. --This text refers to the Audio CD edition.\n\nProduct Description\nIn Boom!, Tom Brokaw, one of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s premier journalists and the acclaimed \nauthor of The Greatest Generation, gives us an epic portrait of another \ndefining era in America: the tumultuous Sixties. The voices and stories \nof both famous people and ordinary citizens come together in this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œvirtual \nreunionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as Brokaw takes us on a memorable journey through a remarkable \ntime, exploring how individuals and the national mood were affected \nby a controversial era and showing how the aftershocks of the Sixties \ncontinue to resound in our lives today. In the reflections of a generation, \nBrokaw also discovers lessons that might guide us in the years ahead. \nRace, politics, war, feminism, popular culture, and music are all delved \ninto here. Brokaw explores how members of this generation have gone \non to bring activism and a Sixties mindset into individual entrepreneurship \n, as we hear stories of how this formative decade has shaped our perspectives \non business, the environment, politics, family, and our national existence. \nRemarkable in its insights, wonderfully written and reported, this revealing \nbook lets us join in these frank conversations about America then, now, \nand tomorrow.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaDaEAadF&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/MaDaEAadF&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2efcd84c825828b08a39cc8c79b062c5dd1363cc","amp;dn":"Tom+Brokaw+-+Boom%21+Voices+of+the+Sixties+Personal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2efcd84c825828b08a39cc8c79b062c5dd1363cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,252,216,76,130,88,40,176,138,57,204,140,121,176,98,197,221,19,99,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
