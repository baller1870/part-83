Kekele, the Congolese answer to Cuba's Buena Vista Social Club, are survivors from that era; now based in Paris and mostly in their 50s, they are still cheery and on good form, and are enjoying a new lease of life as musicians.\n\nThe band has slimmed down since their last album two years ago, and Papa Noel is no longer in the line-up. However, there remains four lead singers, including Wuta Mayi (who once sang for the Congo's greatest musical hero, Franco) and Nyboma Mwan'dido, once with Quatre Etoiles. Another veteran Etoiles hero, Syran Mbenza, adds in the gently rousing guitar solos, while horns, violin and accordion provide the backing. \n\nEAC log CUE and Artwork included.\n\nPlease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11bab9714aae1b20051a6908ea760b7b0b5630b","amp;dn":"Kekele+Cong+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11bab9714aae1b20051a6908ea760b7b0b5630b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,27,171,151,20,170,225,178,0,81,166,144,142,167,96,183,176,181,99,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
