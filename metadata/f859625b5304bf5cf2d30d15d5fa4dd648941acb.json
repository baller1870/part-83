Penned by Turner, the song rolls death, temptation, and  redemption into the metaphor of a funeral train, and sung in Turner's deep voice, it  rolls across country radio like nothing else on the scene, the ominous breath of  hellfire in the lyrics conjuring up the ghost of Johnny Cash. \n    \n  Track Listing....: \n  01.Long black train [04:11] \n  02.In my dreams [03:35] \n  03.What it ain't [03:27] \n  04.I had one one time [03:17] \n  05.Jacksonville [03:56] \n  06.Backwoods boy [03:41] \n  07.Unburn all our bridges [03:19] \n  08.You don't mess around with [03:18] \n  jim \n  09.She'll go on you [04:03] \n  10.Good woman bad [03:01] \n  11.The difference between A [03:43] \n  woman and A man \n  ____ \n  \n  39:31 min \n  60,6 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f859625b5304bf5cf2d30d15d5fa4dd648941acb","amp;dn":"Josh_Turner-Long_Black_Train-%28Retail%29-2003-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f859625b5304bf5cf2d30d15d5fa4dd648941acb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,89,98,91,83,4,191,92,242,211,13,21,213,250,77,214,72,148,26,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
