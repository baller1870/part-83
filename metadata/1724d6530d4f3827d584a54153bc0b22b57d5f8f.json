Actually, it's just a convenient way for me to send 10gb of data to a friend, but maybe there's more demand for it..\nBasically the videos from here: http://www.lordkat.com/dungeons-dragons - saved as flv, so you can watch them in a normal player instead of the browser.\n\nThese are online D&amp;D Sessions with Spoony form spoonyexperiment.com as DM and other TGWTG-guys as players. If you don't know who i'm talkin about here... tough luck.\n\nAlso in case someone wonders: I emailed LordKat before creating this torrent and he allowed it.\n\n[edit] I don't know why seeder is still on 0, but i'm seeding at a steady (if somewhat slow) pace.\nAlso, one video (between 19 and 20) is missing, you can find that one here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5971121&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5971121&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1724d6530d4f3827d584a54153bc0b22b57d5f8f","amp;dn":"Dungeons+%26+Dragons+-+Spoonys+campaign","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1724d6530d4f3827d584a54153bc0b22b57d5f8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,36,214,83,13,79,56,39,213,132,165,65,83,188,11,34,181,125,95,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
