In the United States, the first episode of the series originally aired on October 16, 2001. The first five seasons were broadcast on The WB; following The WB's merger with UPN in September 2006, Smallville continued to be aired on the new, combined network, dubbed The CW. The ninth season officially began on September 25, 2009. In early 2010, The CW picked up Smallville for its tenth season. Since the series premiered, it has averaged 4.47 million viewers per episode over its nine seasons.\n\nSmallville follows the life of Clark Kent (Tom Welling), beginning when he is a teenager in the town of Smallville, Kansas, and continuing through high school, college, and his start at the Daily Planet before he adopts the &quot;Superman&quot; persona. As the series progresses, Clark Kent copes with his emerging superpowers (x-ray vision, super hearing, etc.), exploration of his extraterrestrial origins and discovering his true destiny. The series also deals with the people in Clark Kent's life: his human parents, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) and Martha Kent (Annette O'Toole); his friends Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack) and Pete Ross (Sam Jones III); his sometime love interest Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk); Chloe's cousin and Clark's love interest since season eight, Lois Lane (Erica Durance); and his friendship with Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) and how this gradually decays into their mutual enmity of legend.\n\nFormatted to work on iPods","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:510db769544688a005c9de36d8bb3ab854e88136","amp;dn":"Smallville+Seasons+1+to+9+-+iPod+Compatible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"510db769544688a005c9de36d8bb3ab854e88136","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,13,183,105,84,70,136,160,5,201,222,54,216,187,58,184,84,232,129,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
