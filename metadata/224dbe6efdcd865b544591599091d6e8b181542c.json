Enter Tommy Dean on the mic, a brand-new sound in a brand-new musical climate &amp; a 1993 release on Virgin Records.\n\n&quot;Pigs&quot; was not bluesy, hard-rock like it's predecessor. Rather, it was a hard-edged alternative/metal rock record that attempted to battle the new bands that were garnering radio play after the sea-change brought about by the likes of Nirvana, AIC, Soundgarden, Warrior Soul, etc. It did not do well and the band called it quits soon after. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good disc.\n\n&quot;Pigs&quot; was very linear in sound &amp; direction. Even the artwork fit the new-vibe of the band. Tommy Dean's vocals came off as angry &amp; menacing, as did the music. &quot;Down to the Money&quot; &amp; &quot;Nothing To Do With Anything&quot; are excellent. With the best song being the W. Axl Rose &amp; Del James co-written track, &quot;Crash Diet.&quot; Don't know if this band would've ever hit big or even grabbed a gold record but they were certainly better then the results they attained.
