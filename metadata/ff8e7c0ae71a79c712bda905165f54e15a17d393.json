Glamorous widow Hyacinth, and her even more glamorous daughter Cynthia, are soon installed as members of Dr Gibson's household. Their arrival brings unwelcome changes to Molly's life, along with an unwanted secret she must keep. In the meantime, her unfolding relationship with neighbour Squire Hamley, Mrs Hamley, and their sons Roger and Osborne, becomes the source of more troublesome secrets as well as of joy.\n\nNotes\nWives and Daughters was written in the 1860s and serialised in the Cornhill Magazine. It is set in the 1820s and deals to a large extent with the position of women in Society. Elizabeth Gaskell left it unfinished, so any dramatiser of the novel is faced with guessing the intended outcome of the story.\n\nTheresa Heskins previously adapted Lady Audley's Secret for the Woman's Hour serial, and has adapted Bleak House and Great Expectations for the New Vic Theatre, North Staffordshire, where she is Artistic Director.\n\n\n\nAudio Information\nType : mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate : up to 128 (variable)\nMode : stereo\nFrequency : 22,050Hz\nEncoder : Lame 3.98.2\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff8e7c0ae71a79c712bda905165f54e15a17d393","amp;dn":"Wives+and+Daughters+-+Elizabeth+Gaskell+%28BBC+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff8e7c0ae71a79c712bda905165f54e15a17d393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,142,124,10,231,26,121,199,18,189,169,5,22,95,84,225,90,23,211,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
