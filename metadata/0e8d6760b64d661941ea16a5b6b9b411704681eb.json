Although Mingus* small-group recordings are the ones most often cited as his premier works, this album does, in fact, rank at the top of his oeuvre and compares favorably with the finest large-ensemble jazz recordings by anyone, including Ellington.\n- Brian Olewnick/AMG\n\n\n\nLet My Children Hear Music is a 1972 jazz album by Charles Mingus. In the original liner notes, Mingus described it as *the best album I have ever made*.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll tracks composed by Charles Mingus.\n\nSide A\n\n      1.
