As he teams up again with L.A. cop Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), Foley's investigation leads him to Wonder World, a theme park that is also the front for a major counterfeiting ring. More action and less wit are the trademarks of this film, which features Murphy dishing out his usual wisecracks, but with less flair and freshness than in the original film. Alan Young plays the old man who runs the amusement park, an interesting setting that still adds little to the tired premise.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61f2835c2a4ea8c772ca0653b04892486be457e9","amp;dn":"Beverly+Hills+Cop+3%281994%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61f2835c2a4ea8c772ca0653b04892486be457e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,242,131,92,42,78,168,199,114,202,6,83,176,72,146,72,107,228,87,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
