It generally aired on the first Saturday of each month at 7:30PM, each show running 45 minutes. 133 shows were produced. The show was hosted by German actor and comedian Ilja Richter. \n\nThe show focussed on chart hits current at the time of airing, giving about equal airtime to international pop music and German Schlager. Despite its name, it did not particularly focus on disco music although it featured many disco hits as long as they were chart relevant. (The name of the show was devised before disco as a musical style existed). \n\n&quot;Buddy Joe&quot; is a song from Together, an album by Dutch hard rock band Golden Earring, released in 1972. This 4th single was a strangely poppy song for the band, not far from what the Shocking Blue were doing at the times (&quot;Inkpot&quot; had been a hit 3 months before, and it's maybe the reason why there is a &quot;Sitar&quot;, a plucked stringed instrument, on &quot;Buddy Joe&quot;). Sung by George Kooymans (lead guitarist) and not by Barry Hay (lead vocalist).\n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_(Golden_Earring_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_(Golden_Earring_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6800kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:39\n \n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
