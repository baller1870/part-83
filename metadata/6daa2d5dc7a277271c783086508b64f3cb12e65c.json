The show looks back at Jack's reinvention as Vince St Clair, the time he dressed up as a woman in order to join the ladies' bowling team and the moment when his long-suffering wife Vera served up his beloved pigeons to him in a pie. Friends and Coronation Street colleagues celebrate Bill's work and recall Jack Duckworth's life. With contributions from Tarmey, Liz Dawn, Julie Goodyear, William Roache, Nigel Pivaro, Roy Barraclough, Vicky Binns, Alan Halsall, Katherine Kelly, John Stevenson and Daran Little.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6daa2d5dc7a277271c783086508b64f3cb12e65c","amp;dn":"Coronation+Street+Farewell+Jack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6daa2d5dc7a277271c783086508b64f3cb12e65c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,170,45,93,199,162,119,39,28,120,48,134,80,139,100,243,203,18,230,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
