All 14 tracks were cut in a single eight-hour session with no time for overdubs at the end of one of Arnold's tours, which adds a more edgy but still professional tone to the album. Hummel's tight band included a young Rusty Zinn on guitar and noted blues pianist Tom Mahon, both of whom take their share of solos and push Arnold to some of his better late-period performances. The program runs through standard Chicago shuffles and tempos, with tough remakes of Billy Boy's own big hits such as &quot;I Ain't Got You,&quot; &quot;You Got Me Wrong,&quot; and the dependable &quot;I Wish You Would&quot; as icing on the cake. Hummel keeps the sound stripped down and his band doesn't hot dog the proceedings, while providing a solid and energized backup for Arnold's expressive vocals and sturdy harp. While the world probably doesn't need another version of his old friend Bo Diddley's &quot;I'm a Man,&quot; this one adds extra verses most blues fans haven't heard. Arnold pays tribute to Little Walter by including a cover of Walter's arrangement of &quot;Me and Piney Brown.&quot; He also brings a few tracks from his mentor, Sonny Boy Williamson I, with &quot;Sonny Boy's Jump&quot; and &quot;I Hear My Name Ringing.&quot;\n\n\nTracklist\n1.
