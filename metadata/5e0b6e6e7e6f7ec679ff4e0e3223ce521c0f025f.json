He is looking for the singer Nora Luca, whom his father had heard all the time before his death. Wandering along a frozen road, he meets old Izidor, a member of the Roma (Gypsy) and tells him of Nora Luca. Izidor seems to understand and takes him to his village. StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane believes that Izidor will take him to Nora Luca when the time has come. So, he lives in the Roma(Gypsy) village for several months. The other inhabitants dislike him at first (as he comes from those who call them thieves and attack their folks) but when they as they get to know him better, they grow to like him. In summer, the ice between him and beautiful Sabina finally cracks, and as she is able to translate between the Roma and him, StÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©phane finds out that nobody ever understood a thing that he had said.\n\n\n\n\n IMDb.............: User Rating of 7,2/10\n\n Year.............: 1999\n Country..........: France\n Runtime..........: 97 Minutes\n Audio............: Romanian, Romany, French (all in one track)\n Subtitles........: Norwegian Swedish Danish Finnish\n Video Format.....: PAL\t\n Aspect Ratio.....: 16:9\n DVD Format.......: Anamorphic\n DVD Source.......: DVD9\n DVD Distributor..: Another World Entertainment\n Program..........: AnyDVD \n Average Bit Rate.: 7198 kbps\n\nMenus..............: Untouched\nVideo..............: Untouched\nDVD-extras.........: Untouched\nDVD-Audio..........: Untouched","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e0b6e6e7e6f7ec679ff4e0e3223ce521c0f025f","amp;dn":"Gadjo+Dilo+%2F+Fr%C3%83%C2%A4mlingen+%281997%29+NORDIC+PAL+DVD9+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e0b6e6e7e6f7ec679ff4e0e3223ce521c0f025f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,11,110,110,126,111,126,198,121,255,78,14,50,35,206,82,28,15,2,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
