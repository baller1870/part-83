In Nicolas Entel's film             \n           Sebastian tells of his extraordinary childhood, growing        \n           up with a father he loved but whom he knew to be               \n           Colombia's enemy number one. He tells of times of              \n           extraordinary luxury and extravagance, and other times on      \n           the run. And Sebastian and his widow open the family           \n           vaults to share their private and long hidden archives.        \n           But this is also the story of two of Escobar's most            \n           prominent victims, the Minister of Justice and a               \n           politician about to be elected President of Colombia, as       \n           told by their sons. They were among hundreds that Escobar      \n           had killed in the 1980's. The film follows Sebastian as        \n           he tries to break the cycle of revenge and assassination       \n           by seeking reconciliation with the sons of his father's        \n           victims.                                                       \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Pablo Escobar.............. : ..Himself (archive footage)      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                   Thanks to our friends at SADPANDA.
