After jazz studies\nin Hilversum (Netherlands) and New York, she has performed in many countries\nsuch as Turkey, Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, Germany, the United States, Lithuania,\nMalaysia and Switzerland. Inspired by jazz greats like Thelonious Monk, Les\nMcCann or Herbie Hancock (and sometimes even called &quot;the blond Monk&quot;), Anke\nHelfrich makes good use of the groovy and powerful tradition of Afro-American\njazz piano while developing her personal ideas and style. &quot;When Anke Helfrich\nlays her hands on the keys&quot;, German Jazz Podium wrote, &quot;the jazz fan knows what\nto expect: a tremendously swinging music with contemporary ingredients. Jazz\nthat is pure fun.&quot;\n\nAs one may expect, this fine pianist has won many competitions and awards, among\nthem the &quot;European Jazz Competition 1996&quot;, the &quot;Hennessy Jazz Search 1998&quot; and\nthe &quot;Jazz Award of the City of Worms 2003&quot;. Her 2006 album &quot;Better Times Ahead&quot;\n(featuring Roy Hargrove) was voted &quot;CD of the month&quot; by German magazine\nStereoplay. &quot;This lady swings like the devil&quot;, Swiss newspaper Weltwoche\nreads. &quot;Anke Helfrich is god-damned beautiful and talented -- furthermore you\ncan hear that she is also intelligent. Her ideas and especially her tunes are\nfresh, relaxed and inventive.&quot;\n\nOn &quot;Stormproof&quot;, her third album as a leader, Anke Helfrich pays tribute to some\nof her heroes (Thelonious Monk, Les McCann, Kurt Weill) but never forgets to\npresent her original talents. Ranging from complex, energetic, suite-like pieces\n(&quot;Stormproof&quot;, &quot;In Good Times&quot;) to soft and romantic moments (&quot;Sehnsucht&quot;,\n&quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Little Giant&quot;), her own tunes prove this pianist to be also a\ntop-notch composer. Henning Sieverts and Dejan Terzic, experienced players in\ntheir own right, manage to translate Anke's free-wheeling, rhythmic style into a\nunique trio effort. Special guest Nils Wogram (on 5 tracks), one of the best\ntrombone players around, adds nothing but beauty to the music thus demonstrating\nthe depth of the compositions. Jazz tradition heading for the future.\n\n[...]\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.anke-helfrich.d","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b797853e36c82ece07c8132329ae77ca30808a12","amp;dn":"Anke+Helfrich+-+Stormproof+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b797853e36c82ece07c8132329ae77ca30808a12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,151,133,62,54,200,46,206,7,200,19,35,41,174,119,202,48,128,138,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
