In 2008, they released their sophomore album Highway Prayer, produced by Colin Linden. Highway Prayer has received critical praise both nationally &amp; internationally including a debut at #2 on the Euro Americana Chart , a Western Canadian Music Award for Outstanding Roots Album Duo/Group, a 2009 JUNO nomination for ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRoots &amp; Traditional Album of the YearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nTwilight Hotel is the musical partnership of Brandy Zdan &amp; Dave Quanbury. Together they possess an elusive chemistry and musical style that is dark, moody and rooted in some kind of nostalgic passion for scratchy records and vintage guitar tones. They combine a rock n roll sensibility, compelling songwriting, and haunting arrangements while standing comfortably outside your predictable genre box.\n\nIn late 2009 Zdan &amp; Quanbury made the trek across the New Mexico/Arizona desert from their new home in Austin, TX to Los Angeles, CA to record their third album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhen The Wolves Go BlindÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. They holed up in Kingsize soundlabs for 3 days and laid down the album live off the floor. \n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Folk\t\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.When The Wolves Go Blind\n02.What Do I Know About Love\n03.Mahogany Veneer\n04.The Master\n05.Dream Of Letting Go\n06.Frozen Town\n07.The Darkness\n08.Ham Radio Blues\n09.Golden Eagle\n10.Poor &amp; Hungry\n11.Whem I'm Gone\n12.Golden Eagle (Radio Edit) (Bonus Track)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c6fac4a0afcb46ffd4113bd762237bdee10df9","amp;dn":"Twilight+Hotel+-+When+The+Wolves+Go+Blind+%282011%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c6fac4a0afcb46ffd4113bd762237bdee10df9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,198,250,196,160,175,203,70,255,212,17,59,215,98,35,123,222,225,13,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
