She became a child star at 14 with the worldwide success of her single &quot;Joe le taxi&quot;. Since then, she has accomplished a career in music, movies and modelling.\n\nHer first TV appearance was on the show L'ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â°cole des fans in 1981. She recorded her first single, &quot;La Magie des surprises-parties&quot;, in 1983 and performed it in an Italian festival in 1985 but lost the first prize.\n\nAlthough &quot;La Magie des surprises-parties&quot; was not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which she would become internationally famous, &quot;Joe le taxi&quot;, in 1987, while she was still only 14 years old. It was #1 in France for 11 weeks and, unusually for a song sung in French, was released in the United Kingdom the following year (25 January), where it reached #3. It was taken from her first album M&amp;J (it stands for Marilyn &amp; John) which, although it gained a number 13 placing in France, drew little attention in the UK and did not chart. In March 1989, aged 16, she decided to drop out of high school in order to pursue her career. She then released Variations sur le mÃƒÆ’Ã‚Âªme t'aime in 1990, containing a remake of the Lou Reed song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. The album was written by acclaimed French composer Serge Gainsbourg, whom she met when she received the best singer award at Les Victoires de la Musique, on February, 4th 1990. In 1990, Paradis won the 1990 CÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sar Award for Most Promising Actress for her role in Noce Blanche.\n\nIn 1991, Paradis promoted a fragrance for Chanel, titled Coco. In the advertisement, she was dressed in all black and feathers, portraying a bird swinging in a cage. The advert was shot by Jean-Paul Goude. Paradis spoke of her continued admiration of Chanel in 2010 saying, &quot;The more I know them, the more I love Chanel.&quot;\n\nIn 1992, she moved to the United States, to work with rock musician Lenny Kravitz. Paradis started working on a new album in English, a language in which she was now fluent. Written and produced by Kravitz, the album, titled Vanessa Paradis, topped the French chart and briefly made the UK listings (number 45). One of the singles from it was &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, which made number 5 in France and gave her another Top 10 UK hit (number 6).\n\nIn March 1993, Paradis started her first international tour, the &quot;Natural High Tour&quot;; she performed in France, England and Canada. The tour was canceled before she could perform in Japan and in the United States, for health reasons.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c6c545f8f05aef21b2b826c44fe1275b20de984","amp;dn":"Vanessa+Paradis+-+Ma+Petroleuse+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c6c545f8f05aef21b2b826c44fe1275b20de984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,108,84,95,143,5,174,242,27,43,130,108,68,254,18,117,178,13,233,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
