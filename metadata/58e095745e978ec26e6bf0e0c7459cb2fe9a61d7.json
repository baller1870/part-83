The majority of the tracks previously appeared on a 1994 album called &quot;The bridge&quot; which was credited to Cousins and Willoughby. The line up on that album was augmented by a number of current and former Strawbs members including Chas Cronk, Blue Weaver and Richard Hudson. Mary Hopkin also featured on the album, her wonderful vocals offering an instant reminder of the earliest days of the Strawbs when they boasted Sandy Denny in their line up. Cousins and Willoughby toured as the Electric Strawbs and the Acoustic Strawbs at various times, joined by other band members including Dave Lambert. Lambert makes a couple of appearances on this album, joined on both the tracks by another former Strawbs member Rod Coombes. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58e095745e978ec26e6bf0e0c7459cb2fe9a61d7","amp;dn":"Strawbs...Blue+Angel%282003%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58e095745e978ec26e6bf0e0c7459cb2fe9a61d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,224,149,116,94,151,142,194,110,107,240,224,199,69,156,178,254,154,97,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
