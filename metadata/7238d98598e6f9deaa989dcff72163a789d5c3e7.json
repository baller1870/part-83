Also, while not a proper reason, their muxing     \n         tool is broken and causes video to not play back in some      \n         applications like MPCHC, so perhaps their coder can take      \n         another shot at it. As for the read NFO portion, this         \n         show is clearly not HDTV. It is upconverted widescreen        \n         SD, much like Hell's Kitchen (US). Obvious signs of this      \n         are the very soft picture, excessive edge enhancement,        \n         and excessive cropping needed compared to other, real HD      \n         programs on the same network. Also, the lack of a Presented   \n          in HD logo at the start is a helpful sign.                    \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n       \n          Group Greets     \n                                     \n                                        \n                                                                  \n                                                                     \n                           CTU, ORENJi, 2HD, DHD                       \n                                                                        \n            and all other groups that choose quality over speed         \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                                                                     \n                                                                  \n      \n        \n       Contact Info      \n                                      \n                                        \n                                                                  \n       We are currently looking for:                                  \n                                                                       \n           * US/CA cappers with HDTV and/or DSR feed - min 60 kB/s      \n                                                                        \n         GROUP NEWS: No, we will not affil your brand new/DR/colo site, \n                     so please don't ask.
