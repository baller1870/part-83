First conceived as a &quot;babysitter murder movie&quot; the young-gun director, along with a group of recent film school grads and a gang of eager but inexperienced actors, tackled Halloween's 21-day shooting schedule, $325,000 budget and an ambitious four-minute long take to become the stuff of indie-film legend. This is an inspirational story of young artists coming together and a &quot;behind-the-mask&quot; look at one of the creepiest horror flicks of all time. Jamie Lee Curtis, John Carpenter, Rob Zombie and more provide insightful commentary dealing with everything from having five different Michael Myers' to the movie's legacy as a slasher film that would spawn scores of imitations but not one equal. \n\n2010","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7e2c34dfc88daf5479425094b99c7d7c2b02e73","amp;dn":"Inside+Story%3A+Halloween","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7e2c34dfc88daf5479425094b99c7d7c2b02e73","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,226,195,77,252,136,218,245,71,148,37,9,75,153,199,215,194,176,46,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
