Why don't we have mountains as tall as those on Mars? In\n      the last of this year's Christmas Lectures, Dr Mark Miodownik\n      investigates the world of the very big and very tall. He reveals\n      that, at this scale, everything is governed by a battle with one\n      of the strangest forces in the universe - gravity. With help\n      from acrobats, levitation devices, spiders, birthday cake\n      candles and even some sticky goo, Mark discovers how gravity can\n      make solid rock behave like a liquid and investigates whether\n      one day it might be possible to build a structure from Earth\n      into space, taking us beyond the reach of gravity without the\n      use of rocket.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
