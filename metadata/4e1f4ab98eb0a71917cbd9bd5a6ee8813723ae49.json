Traumatised by his experiences, he knows that he must avoid strong emotions and any kind of stress.  Recently married to Olivia, he hopes to start a new life by opening a restaurant on the National 7 highway, although he is none too pleased when the truckers start flirting with his all-too-pretty wife.  Opposite the restaurant there is a petrol station owned by a man named Pieri, whom Georges begins to suspect of having an affair with his wife.  Doubtful of his wifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fidelity, Georges realises that he is heading for a nervous breakdown.  A dramatic outcome is not far away... \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5294/45374461.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/5294/45374461.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img192.imageshack.us/img192/6786/79625076.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img192.imageshack.us/img192/6786/79625076.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/8163/19979587.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img17.imageshack.us/img17/8163/19979587.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img251.imageshack.us/img251/4732/43768609.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img251.imageshack.us/img251/4732/43768609.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n----not my rip----------\n\nFile Size (in bytes): 1,174,120,448\nDuration (hh:mm:ss): 1:32:53\n\nVideo Codec Name: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nFrame Count: 139303\nFrame Width (pixels): 640\nFrame Height (pixels): 480\nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;): 1.333\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate (kbps): 1579\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame: 0.206&quot;\n\nAudio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz): 48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps): 94\nAudio Bitrate Type: VBR\nAudio Channel Count: 1           \n\n********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
