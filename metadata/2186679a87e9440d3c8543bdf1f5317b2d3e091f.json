Has the concentration of power increased in the ensuing decades?\n\nMedia coverage would lead us to believe so, but Francis disagrees. Today, the balance has shifted: only half the families cited 20 years ago and only one of the five conglomerates remain major players. The old boys' network of risk-averse investors has been replaced by daring Canadian innovators, many of them self-made.\n\nWho Owns Canada Now demonstrates that Canada is currently led by business moguls who offer innovative policies and a new vision for the country. Through incisive analysis and exclusive interviews, Francis reveals our country's most powerful players in the most important business topic of the year.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2008 Diane Francis; (P)2008 HarperCollins Publishers Ltd.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2186679a87e9440d3c8543bdf1f5317b2d3e091f","amp;dn":"Who+Owns+Canada+Now","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2186679a87e9440d3c8543bdf1f5317b2d3e091f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,134,103,154,135,233,68,13,60,133,67,189,241,245,49,123,45,62,9,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
