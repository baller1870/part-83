She was never to leave Cheverell Manor alive. Commander Adam Dalgliesh and his team are called in to investigate the murder, and later a second death, which are to raise even more complicated problems than the question of innocence or guilt.\n\nMany thanks to BoaterLady at Audio Book Emporium for the original rip.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d82936578ee0c831fb8ebb9388045005dbd7a692","amp;dn":"The+Private+Patient+-+P+D+James++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d82936578ee0c831fb8ebb9388045005dbd7a692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,41,54,87,142,224,200,49,251,142,187,147,136,4,80,5,219,215,166,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
