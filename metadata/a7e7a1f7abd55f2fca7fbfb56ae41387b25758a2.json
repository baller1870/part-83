GHO) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\n\nI have taken it from a Chinese board, actually I did test MANY ghost releases, and I liked only this one, I have selected sp2 for some reason, as I know some of my mates (even at SRN too) who still prefer sp2, and above all it will not have any driver conflicts as some users r reported to have issues with sp3, this one has driver packs of sound, graphics (custom made), mass storage, WLAN, LAN (these 3 r official BTS packs which I have included, after restoration of image, when your system will restart, and load windows, then before this, a selection dialog will appear, you SHOULD select all driver packs to extract, as I had to edit packs to enter BTS packs.. Then at desktop you will see An eXPerience folder, plz apply those tweaks (those r from tiny xp full from ultra dvd, I have chosen it coz it belongs to last sp2 release.
