View detailed network information, graph network signal strength, and automatically join the best open network in range. \n\nWhether you are driving around looking for wireless networks, stuck in traffic, sitting on the beach, or if you are curious how strong your wireless signal is at home, AirRadar provides a more linear approach to network hunting. Setup a scan frequency, and have new open or closed networks have their name spoken, play alerts, or display notifications. \n\nVarious other options allow you to customize your network list further, including assigning colors to best open networks and sound cues. Download it today, and take the hardship out of getting an internet connection at a critical time.\n\n\nWHAT'S NEW\nVersion 2.1:\nBug Fix: Fixed a crash bug removing columns via the menubar which appeared more than once.\n\n\n\n\nENJOY!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2111191cab0c48b36543de3ab84b58d7b0dbddc9","amp;dn":"AirRadar+2.1+%5BUB+k%5C%27d%5D.dmg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2111191cab0c48b36543de3ab84b58d7b0dbddc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,17,25,28,171,12,72,179,101,67,222,58,184,75,88,215,176,219,221,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
