They are commonly used on a removable storage device such as a CD, USB flash drive, flash card, or floppy disk.A portable application does not leave its files or settings on the host computer. Typically this means that the application does not write to the Windows registry or store its configuration files (such as an INI file) in the user's profile; instead, it stores its configuration files in the program's directory. Another requirement, since file paths will often differ on changing computers due to variation in Windows drive letter assignments, is the need for applications to store them in a relative format. While some applications have options to support this behavior, many programs are not designed to do this. A common technique for such programs is the use of a launcher program to copy necessary settings and files to the host computer when the application starts and move them back to the application's directory when it closes.-more details at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application )\n\n\n\nUnrar , start instalation of your TuneUp ,follow the steps and when it ask registration use any name you want, company is optional, and use the serial from the .txt file (if it doesnt work use keygens from Activation folder) .
