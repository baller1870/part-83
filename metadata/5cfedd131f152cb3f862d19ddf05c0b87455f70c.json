Jackson is joined by electric keyboards and electric bass on most selections in addition to a couple of Latin percussionists and as many as four singers. Yet even with the many studio musicians, Jackson's basic bebop approach is unchanged and the repertoire includes several standards (such as &quot;Bags' Groove,&quot; &quot;The Days of Wine and Roses&quot; and &quot;I'm Getting Sentimental over You&quot;) that he has performed a countless number of times.\n\nTracks\n01 - Big Mouth\n02 - The Look Of Love\n03 - Bags' Grove\n04 - I Love You\n05 - The Days Of Wine And Roses\n06 - Yusef\n07 - I'm Getting Sentimental Over You\n08 - I Owes Ya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5cfedd131f152cb3f862d19ddf05c0b87455f70c","amp;dn":"Milt+Jackson+-+1981+-+Big+Mouth+%28OJC+865%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5cfedd131f152cb3f862d19ddf05c0b87455f70c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,254,221,19,31,21,44,179,248,98,209,157,223,5,192,184,116,85,247,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
