The fact that he supports the backup format RAR, it probably explains not. In addition, the program can work with archives ZIP, CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, ACE 2.0, BZIP, JAR, UUE, GZIP, BZIP2 and 7-Zip, while it has many very useful features - encryption, support of continuous (solid) archives, in which the compression ratio can be 10 - 50% more than the usual methods of special compression algorithm compresses multimedia files, support of multivolume archives, and many others.\n\nMain features of WinRAR:\n&quot;Full support for RAR and ZIP archives\n&quot;Using the original high-performance data compression algorithm\n&quot;Having a graphical environment that supports drag and drop (drag &amp; drop)\n&quot;You can use command line interface\n&quot;Managing the archives of other formats (CAB, ARJ, LZH, TAR, GZ, TAR.GZ, BZ2, TAR.BZ2, ACE, UUE, JAR, ISO, 7Z, Z)\n&quot;Support for the method of continuous backup for better compression\n&quot;Support of multivolume archives\n&quot;Creating self-extracting (SFX) conventional and multivolume archives with a standard or optional SFX modules\n&quot;The ability to recover physically damaged archives\n&quot;The ability to create and use of recovery volumes, allowing to reconstruct missing parts of multivolume archives.\n&quot;Support for Unicode encoding in filenames\n&quot;Additional functions (data encryption and file names in the archive, add comments archival, management protocol error)\n&quot;Using a third-party registration interface in the form of individual topics\n\n WinRAR - What's new in the latest version\n   Version 4.00 beta 5\n\n   1. Now WinRAR command line mode -ibck switch is applicable to most of\n      archive processing operations, not just archiving and extracting.\n\n   2. Default compression profile options do not modify extraction behavior\n      anymore and &quot;Background archiving&quot; option does not work for extraction.\n      So we added the separate &quot;Background extraction&quot; option in &quot;Advanced&quot;\n      part of extraction dialog. You can save the default state of this option\n      with &quot;Save settings&quot; button in &quot;General&quot; part of extraction dialog,\n      just like for other extraction options.\n\n   3. Switch -cfg- disables use of &quot;Default folder for archives&quot; from\n      WinRAR settings in WinRAR command line mode. Also it forces WinRAR\n      to ignore &quot;Select for archives&quot; fields in &quot;Organize passwords&quot; dialog.\n\n   4. &quot;Mode...&quot; button in the operation progress window is enabled also\n      when extracting or testing archives. It provides access to \n      &quot;Command parameters&quot; dialog, where you can set &quot;Turn PC off when done&quot;\n      option for extraction and test operations.\n\n      Previously this dialog was accessible only when archiving.\n\n   5. Double clicking on a password record in &quot;Organize passwords&quot; dialog\n      works like &quot;Edit&quot; button, opening &quot;Password information&quot; dialog.\n      Previous beta versions ignored the double click in &quot;Organize passwords&quot;.\n\n   6. Bugs fixed:\n\n      a) &quot;a&quot; and &quot;s&quot; commands with -iicon and -iimg switches did not remove\n         temporary files in WinRAR temporary folder after completion;\n\n      b) &quot;Enable autocomplete&quot; option in &quot;Organize passwords&quot; dialog\n         did not allow to disable the autocomplete feature in Windows XP.\n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES]\n================\n\n1.) Run installer (choose 32 or 64 bit version)\n2.) Copy the rarreg.key in install folder ( C:\\Program Files\\WinRar )\n\nNOTE: I did not included the Keygen only a reg key;\n      especially for users who don't trust keygens.\nI'm sure that you'll find the CORE &amp; FFF Keygens for WinRar somewhere here at PirateBay\n(if you have a Core/FFF keygen (v3.93) that works too)\nDone,\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3caf8b0a5261e4d06c7d76a5b4280dd73fe2fac","amp;dn":"WinRAR+4.00+Beta+5+%28x86-x64%29+%2B+RegKey+%28no+Keygen%29+%5BTrT-TcT%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3caf8b0a5261e4d06c7d76a5b4280dd73fe2fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,202,248,176,165,38,30,77,6,199,215,106,91,66,128,221,115,254,47,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
