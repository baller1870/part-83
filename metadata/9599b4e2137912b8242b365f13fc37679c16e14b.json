After arresting a drug baron named Memo Lucero (Geno Silva), the mysterious &quot;Diablo&quot; steps in and organizes the assassination of Vetter, but his wife, Stacy (Jacqueline Obradors), is killed instead.\n\nLooking for revenge, Vetter acts outside the law to punish his wife's murderers. To accomplish that, he asks Memo, who is now in prison, for help finding Diablo. With Hicks' help, he hunts every member of the cartel from the bottom to the top of the organization's hierarchy and finds that &quot;Memo&quot; is linked to the recent activities.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9599b4e2137912b8242b365f13fc37679c16e14b","amp;dn":"A+Man+Apart+%282003%29+DVDrip+Eng+%5Bwulfy1978%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9599b4e2137912b8242b365f13fc37679c16e14b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,153,180,226,19,121,18,184,36,43,54,95,19,252,55,103,156,22,225,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
