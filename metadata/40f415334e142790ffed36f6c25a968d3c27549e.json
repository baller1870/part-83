Part Of The Mix\n\n\nwww.allewismusic.com\n \n&quot;Al Lewis is a singer-songwriter from North Wales who now shares his time between Cardiff and London.\n\nA relative latecomer to music, it all began in earnest, back in 2007 when Al released his first two singles 'Waiting for You' and 'I'll be the Moon' and a Welsh language EP entitled 'Byw mewn Breuddwyd' all on his own label. In March that year Al co-wrote and performed the song 'Llosgi' (Burning) on the televised 'Song For Wales' competition, winning the songwriters category and coming second overall. Al would go on to perform slots at the 'Wakestock Festival' alongside Mark Ronson and at the inaugural 'Swn Festival' in Cardiff organised by Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens.\n\nNow a regular face on the Welsh Language music scene, 2008 saw two further releases, 'Dilyn Pob Cam' &amp; 'One Way Love Affair (EP)', gaining Al further exposure via plays on BBC 6 Music.\n\nIn 2009 Al released his first Welsh Language album, spending several weeks at number one in the Welsh Language album charts. In the same year a new EP (Skin &amp; Bones) in collaboration with fellow Welsh compatriot, Paper Aeroplanes' Sarah Howells, was released.\n\nWith a sound reminiscent of the classic singer-songwriters of the 70's (Tim Buckley, James Taylor), but delivered with a modern twist akin to Bright Eyes &amp; Sufjan Stephens, the big city is already holding much promise for the boy from Wales.&quot;\n\n\nIf you like this album please support the artist by purchasing some of his other albums or go and see him live.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40f415334e142790ffed36f6c25a968d3c27549e","amp;dn":"Al+Lewis-+In+the+Wake+%2B+I%5C%27ll+be+the+moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40f415334e142790ffed36f6c25a968d3c27549e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,244,21,51,78,20,39,144,255,237,54,246,194,90,150,141,60,39,84,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
