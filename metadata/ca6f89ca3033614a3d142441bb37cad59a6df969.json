Initial materia of some characters have also \nbeen changed. \n\n* Stealing items is generally easier and more rewarding, especially in the first part of the game.\n\n* Cloud now requires slightly more XP to level up to reduce the level gap between him and other party members on higher levels. \n\n\nMonsters:\n\n* All monsters have increased stats, hp and mp. \n\n* You can no longer morph monsters into source-items. \n\n* Emerald Weapon is immune to gravity.\n\n* Movers are now less of an ap gold mine and Magic Pot will now only give you gold when you feed it elixirs. \n\n* Some bosses have been rebalanced and most bosses are now immune to slow, stop and darkness.\n\n* Some monsters in the crater can no longer be manipulated, such as Dark Dragon, however you can now obtain the enemy skill Dragon Force from\nBlue Dragon.\n\n* Some monsters such as Master Tornberry, Stinger and Vlakorados have had  their hp and/or immunities changed. \n\n* You will no longer win any items from CMD. Grand Horn.\n\n\nEquipment:\n\n* Some weapons and armors have been rebalanced, e.g. weapons/armors  without materia slots/growth. \n\n* Ultimate weapons no longer have any special super damage formula which makes them give 10.000+ in damage, but is still of course the best\nweapon for each character and now even have materia growth. \n\n* Ribbons protect against *all* status effects which means you can't use haste, barriers, reflect or regen together with a ribbon. \n\n* Tetra elemental now half elemental damage. \n\n\nMateria:\n\n* Some spells have been rebalanced, most enemy skills require more mp to use.\n\n* White Wind removes *all* status effects (effect same as ribbon.)\n\n* Some materia requires more ap to level up.\n\n* HP/MP Plus materia have had it's effect reduced.\n\n* Knights of the Round is still the most powerful and praiseworthy spell of the game, but you will now have to pay for what you get. \n\n* Instant death spells is more expensive and will be less effective in the crater.\n\n\n--- Enjoy this game.
