Is it time to become a manager? Tell your boss heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a jerk? Join that startup? Author Michael Lopp recalls his own make-or-break moments with Silicon Valley giants such as Apple, Netscape, and Symantec in Being Geek -- an insightful and entertaining book that will help you make better career decisions.\n\nWith more than 40 standalone stories, Lopp walks through a complete job life cycle, starting with the job interview and ending with the realization that it might be time to find another gig. Many books teach you how to interview for a job or how to manage a project successfully, but only this book helps you handle the baffling circumstances you may encounter throughout your career.\n\nDecide what you're worth with the chapter on &quot;The Business&quot;\nDetermine the nature of the miracle your CEO wants with &quot;The Impossible&quot;\nGive effective presentations with &quot;How Not to Throw Up&quot;\nHandle liars and people with devious agendas with &quot;Managing Werewolves&quot;\nRealize when you should be looking for a new gig with &quot;The Itch&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155414/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596155414/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a geek, and I might be a nerd, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not a dork.\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been at these definitions long enough to see them transformed\nfrom cruel words of judgment to badges of honor and labels of\npraise, but even with dramatically better PR and social standing,\nweÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still a demographic saddled with debilitating social skills,\nstrange control issues, and an insatiable appetite for information.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦and we donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even have a good definition for the labels weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve\ngiven ourselves.\n\nSome of the content for this book was first seen in the Rands in\nRepose weblog, and many years ago I made a snap decision about\nwhether to embrace the word nerd or geek to describe my demographic.\nI was writing a lightweight article regarding attention deficiency\ndisorder and I needed an acronym, because nothing dresses\nup an idea like a clever acronym.\n\nThe choices were Nerd Attention Deficiency Disorder (N.A.D.D.)\nor Geek Attention Deficiency Disorder (G.A.D.D.). While neither\nrolls of the tongue, N.A.D.D. struck me as slightly less terrible. This\nbrief decision had lasting impact because, moving forward, I exclusively\nused nerd in my articles.\nÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â»Ã‚Â¿\nIt is a defining characteristic of the nerd or geek to seek definition.\nThis makes my off-the-cuff nerd naming choice an ongoing source\nof annoyance for me. What is the actual definition of the nerd? And\nthe geek? And what about those dorks?\n\nThis annoyance became a full-blown inconvenience as I worked\nwith my editor on this book that is now in your hands. As titles\nwe debated, she came up with the elegant and precise Being Geek.\nRight. Right. Dammit. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s perfect. Problem is, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve never written\nabout geeks. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m a nerd. Or am I?\n\nThe origins of the word donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t help. Geek originally described a circus\nperformer who bit the heads off live animals. Nerd has a more\nhonorable origin in its first documented appearance in Dr. SeussÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s\n1950 book If I Ran the Zoo, where the narrator claims he would\ncollect ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Nerkle, a Nerd, and a Seersucker too.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nSince then, the words have blended. There are clever Venn diagrams\nthat describe the respective traits of nerds versus geeks. Some suggest\nthe geeks are more obsessive than the nerds. Others call out the\nsocial ineptitude of the nerds, but for every definition you find,\nanother can be found to contradict the previous definition.\n\nSo, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a toss up.\n\nThe good news is the lack of a clear delineation between nerd and\ngeek doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t prevent us from tackling dork.\n\nDork is derogatory, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no doubt about it, but it does have a\nplace amongst the geek and nerd definition. The term geek can be\nadded to any number of fields, many of which have little to do with\ntechnology. Movie geek, music geekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½this describes a deep appreciation\nof a thing. My belief is that the term dork is used by geeks to\nposition their geekery above anotherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s geek field. For example, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m\na computer geek, but those movie geeks are dorks.\n\nMake sense?\n\nThe point being, depending on where youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re standing, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re all\ndorks.\n\nAs becoming comfortable with ambiguity is one of the goals of\nthis book, perhaps itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a good opening to understand there really\nisnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t a clear distinction between geek and nerd. While this book is\ncalled Being Geek, IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m likely to throw a few nerds in there for good\nmeasure.\n\nA couple of other conventions to be aware of before we begin:\nFor much of this book, my prototypical geek is a he as a convenience.\nThere are plenty of she geeks out there for which the observations\nof this book equally apply.\n\nThe narrator throughout this book is Rands. This is a pseudonym\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been using for over a decade. The comfortable anonymity of\nRands provides a professional distance from the topics I cover.\nSimilarly, just about every proper name and situation described in\nthis book is fake. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been deliberately constructed in order to\ntell a tale.\n\nAnd that tale starts now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85c87aa54f956454fe5b7829a04bd5eadd66bee0","amp;dn":"O%5C%27Reilly+-+Being+Geek+%5BiBook%2C+2010%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85c87aa54f956454fe5b7829a04bd5eadd66bee0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,200,122,165,79,149,100,84,254,91,120,41,160,75,213,234,221,102,190,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
