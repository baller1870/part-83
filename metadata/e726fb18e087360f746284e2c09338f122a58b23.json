Anyone. EVERYONE. \nStoryline: With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, &quot;El Mariachi,&quot; director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of &quot;El Mariachi,&quot; where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hitman and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown. \n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nBitrate:1287 kbps\nFramerate:23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264 \nResolution:720x384 \nAspect Ratio: 1.875 \nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF) 0.194 \n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Title: Once Upon A Time In Mexico 2003 BRRip\nBlu-Ray Release Date: 16th December 2010 \nCertification: Rated R for strong violence, and for language \nFilm Length: 1:41:42\nTagline: In this sequel to 'Desperado', a Mexican drug lord pretends to overthrow the Mexican government, and is connected to a corrupt CIA agent who at that time, demands retribution from his worst enemy to carry out the drug lord's uprising against the government. \nStoryline: The Time Has Come. \n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nBitrate:1322 kbps\nFramerate:23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264 \nResolution:720x400 \nAspect Ratio:16:9 \nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF) 0.191 \n\n\n\nGenre: Action | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nLanguage: English (El Mariachi Dubbed)\nOriginal Source: CHD 720p \n\nAudio Specifications:\n\nFormat: AAC-LC \nBitrate: AAC-LC = 128 kbps / AAC 5.1 = 300 kbps \nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 (Stereo) / AAC 5.1 = 6 channels (3/2 .1) \nLanguage: English\nSample Rate: 48000Hz [Both] \nSubtitles: NONE \n\nPS3, POPCORN HOUR &amp; XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/el1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/el1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/el2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/el2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/des1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/des1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/des2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/des2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/once1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/once1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/once2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/once2.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e726fb18e087360f746284e2c09338f122a58b23","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+A+Time+In+Mexio+Trilogy+BRRip+%5BRelease-Lounge+H264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e726fb18e087360f746284e2c09338f122a58b23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,38,251,24,224,135,54,15,116,98,132,226,192,147,56,241,34,165,139,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
