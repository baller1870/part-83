The latest version now incorporates CPRxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ technology to ensure the highest level of success copying the latest generation of DVD movies. You now have complete control over the final copy. Use the Copy PresetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ or the more advanced features to select what content will be copied and how much compression will be used. With 1CLICK DVD COPY - PRO, you can make a perfect copy with just one CLICK.\nCPRx is a unique and innovative solution to copy new DVD movies which contain bad sectors or bad DVD structure. Many popular DVD movies are now created in such a way as to make it difficult for backup software to copy them properly. This can result in errors during the copy process, or bad playback after the copy is completed.\nIn order to copy a DVD which has been authored using these new schemes, 1CLICK DVD COPY now utilizes state of the art CPRx technology to ensure the highest level of success when making an archival backup. Just as we've become accustomed to relying on anti-virus software to keep us protected against the latest viruses, we must also rely on new updates of CPRx to ensure we can copy the latest DVD releases. With 1CLICK's update notification feature, you can rest assured that you will be notified every time a new version of the software is available.\n\nFeatures of 1Click DVD Copy Pro :\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Windows Vista Compatible\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ CPRxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ technology for copying new DVD movies.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Copy PresetsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ - One click preset for each type of DVD copy.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Preview the movie, extras and menus.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Include or exclude movie and menus based on preview.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Select individual audio, video, and subtitles streams.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Control the amount of video compression used.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Make additional backup copies without re-copying the DVD.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Copy Episodic DVD Movies, TV Series, etc.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Copy a movie to your hard drive - great for laptops.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports copying of Multi-Channel Audio (Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS).\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports both NTSC and PAL DVD movies.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Supports Dual Layer media.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Free software updates and technical support for a year.\n\nCompatible with Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2000, Me or 98SE.\n\nHomepage - http://www.lgsoftwareinnovations.com\n\nxoxoxox\nx FaQ x\nxoxoxox\n\nQ: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'\nA: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; \n   \n   OPTION 1: Download &amp; install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: \n\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n   \n   OPTION 2: Download &amp; install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded\n\nQ: 'I download a keygen from a user &amp; my AV flagged it as a virus!'\nA: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. \n\n   First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.\n   \n   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user &amp; check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. \n\n   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.\n   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.\n\n   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum &amp; report it here: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    \n\nQ: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'\nA: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum &amp; explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772\n\nQ: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'\nA: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701\n\nQ: 'I don't know how to mount an image file.
