Founded in 1985 by publisher Bob Guccione Jr. \nIt competes with industry stalwart Rolling Stone. Madonna was the artist \non the cover of the first issue. In its early years, the magazine was noted for \nits broad music coverage with an emphasis on college-oriented rock music and \non the ongoing emergence of hip-hop.
