Weaver's raspy vocals are oft-compared to Tom Waits and Leonard Cohen. He writes dark, brooding bluesy tunes similar to those two artists though fails to deliver their gut wrenching realism. He succeeds when he steps outside the formula and messes around with different sounds and more tantalizing rhythms. Unfortunately he does so too rarely to make the disc a solid listen all the way through. \n\nThere are, however, definite highlights.\n\n1  Introlude  0:30 \n  2  In November  2:14 \n  3  Wings as Knives 4:12 \n  4  Plastic Bag  4:06 \n  5  Like a Vine After the Sun  3:50 \n  6  The un Elected  3:06 \n  7  Black on Black  3:11 \n  8  Down 25  3:34 \n  9  Surrealism + Blues 4:37 \n  10  Sorrow  4:19 \n  11  Frankie  3:03 \n  12  Geisha 3:32 \n  13  Rain Leaves Smoke  3:19 \n  14  Whatever You Want to Haunt You  3:52\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d31f9e644c03005123f51545cf9f6068f9766555","amp;dn":"Ben+Weaver...Paper+Sky%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d31f9e644c03005123f51545cf9f6068f9766555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,31,158,100,76,3,0,81,35,245,21,69,207,159,96,104,249,118,101,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
