Well-shot and with excellent picture quality (straight from the master). Audio is a little uneven in quality (muffled at first, then with better highs) and has the big venue sound so it's a little unfocused. A very good bootleg. \n\nSetlist:\nDeuce\nKing of the night time world\nDo you love me\nCalling Dr. Love\nCold gin\nWatchin' you\nFirehouse\nI stole your love\nShock me\nAce's solo\nLet me go, rock 'n' roll\nShout it out loud\nStrutter\nGene's solo\nGod of thunder\nPeter's solo\nNew York groove\nLove gun\n100,000 years\nBlack diamond\nDetroit rock city\nBeth\nRock and roll all nite","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1365f23c660a88e693c7f0e12408c5bfd7a3745a","amp;dn":"KISS+-+Philadelphia%2CPA+10-8-1996+extreme+right","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1365f23c660a88e693c7f0e12408c5bfd7a3745a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,101,242,60,102,10,136,230,147,199,240,225,36,8,197,191,215,163,116,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
