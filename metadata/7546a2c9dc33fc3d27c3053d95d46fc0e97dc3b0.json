The band released their self-titled debut album in 1992, just as the hair metal party was coming to a close. The band had a melodic hard rock sound with a slightly bluesy, slightly Southern edge, sort of like Skid Row meets Junkyard. A lot of that style came from vocalist Gary Jeffries and his southern fried vocals.
