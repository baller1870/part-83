When the originally \nAfrican and South influenced Blues were brought to Louisiana, New Orleans, the \nMississippi Delta, new instruments were added - clarinet, brass, piano, mandolins, \naccordions - and along with the banjo mingled into an interesting mix, which would \nbe known as New Orleans, Swamp, Cajun or Riverboat Blues. \n\nThe basics for directions like Jazz, Swing and even Rock &amp; Roll were lain during \nthis time and a distinctive, instantly recognizable sound was created, which would \nimminently be associated with the Blues.\n__________\n\n 1.
