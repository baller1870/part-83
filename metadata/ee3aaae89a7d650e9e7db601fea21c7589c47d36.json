Sure, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a moot point since Brian is a canine, but hey, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s touching that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s willing to sacrifice himself for Peter right?\n\nEqually touching were StewieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s attempts to save Brian, along with his confessions that he didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to lose anyone in the family.  While I do miss the homicidal evil genius Stewie of earlier seasons, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s nice to see the baby has feelings for his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFat Man.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWhile I thought that President ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s scene at the end was clever and unexpected, I also thought that the episode could have stood alone on its own with the main plot.  Also, we finally have an answer for the crazy man-sized chicken!  ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s actually a creation of Dr. Hartman that went awry.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee3aaae89a7d650e9e7db601fea21c7589c47d36","amp;dn":"family+guy+season+9+ep8+new+kidney+in+town","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee3aaae89a7d650e9e7db601fea21c7589c47d36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,58,170,232,154,125,101,14,158,125,182,1,254,162,28,117,137,196,125,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
