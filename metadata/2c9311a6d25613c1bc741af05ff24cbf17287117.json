With the addition of new members the band quickly became much more than just a side project. Still retaining the digital/electronic aspect of our previous endeavors we added guitars, bass and drums to create a more mind blowing sound. We set out for a heavier, synth-infused sound. Problems occurred between a few band members which greatly delayed our progress. MSYC aims to be a positive, drug-free band. Our lyrics are inspirational and by no means intended to offend anyone.\n\n\n1\t\t\nKeepin\\' It Sunny Side Up\n2\t\t\nWe\\'re From Ohio \n3\t  \t\nHoly Hail\n4\t  \t\nPoker Face (Lady Gaga Cover)\n5\t  \t\nSomeone Said You Were Epic\n\nplease seed ive seen all the other ones die :(\n\n\nuploaded by Snow :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c9311a6d25613c1bc741af05ff24cbf17287117","amp;dn":"My+Sky+Your+City+Demo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c9311a6d25613c1bc741af05ff24cbf17287117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,147,17,166,210,86,19,193,188,116,26,240,95,242,76,191,23,40,113,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
