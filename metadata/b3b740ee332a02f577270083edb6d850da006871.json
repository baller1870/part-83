Charlotte Banks (Aly Michalka) has what it takes to be a true rock star, and with the battle of the bands approaching she's determined to win. Her chief opponent in the upcoming competition is none other than her egotistical ex-boyfriend Ben (Scott Porter). Ben may be cocky, but there's no denying his charisma when he takes the stage. With a little help from new arrival Will Burton (Connell), Charlotte's band begins to develop a unique sound and starts writing some original songs. Meanwhile, as Will and singer/guitarist Sa5m (Hudgeons) start to make a love connection, disaster strikes, and the band is forced to choose between conceding the competition or standing tall and finally living up to their true potential. \n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3b740ee332a02f577270083edb6d850da006871","amp;dn":"Bandslam%282009%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3b740ee332a02f577270083edb6d850da006871","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,183,64,238,51,42,2,245,119,39,0,131,237,182,216,80,218,0,104,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
