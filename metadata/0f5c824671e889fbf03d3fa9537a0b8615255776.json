Finance! Silver! \n\nMax and Stacy look at the call from Eric Cantona to withdraw money from the banks, and at the viral Crash JP Morgan Buy Silver campaign by Max Keiser. \n\nIn the second half of the show, Max talks to Alex Jones about Google bombs, naked body scanners and Crash JP Morgan Buy Silver.\n\n\n\nThe .mp3 is audio extracted from the Russia Today video.\n\nYou can watch the video at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0rcNJXFfI&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN0rcNJXFfI&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n \n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.
