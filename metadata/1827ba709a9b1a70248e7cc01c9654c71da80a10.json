He writes songs that have a \n\nstory to tell, and he tells them with a combination of wit, melody and often \n\nheartbreaking description. \n\nWe are all familiar with &quot;The Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot; and &quot;The Green \n\nFields of France,&quot; which were hits for various singers. These are excellent \n\nsongs and they tell very real stories, but Bogle has other tales to relate. \n\nMirrors opens with a song written in the early 1990s that is perhaps more \n\nrelevant today. &quot;Refugee&quot; contains lines like &quot;in the dust and heat the women \n\nqueue for hours for handouts of rice or maize or flour. And old people die \n\nnearly every day, turn their faces to the wall and slip away.&quot; How many such \n\npeople are still queuing and dying over a decade later? \n\nHe also has a go at the aficionados of the folk boom of the 1990s when \n\nanyone with two hands and the price of a guitar thought they were God's gift \n\nto the folk scene and any member of the opposite sex. &quot;Plastic Paddy&quot; uses \n\nalmost every song title from the Aran sweater brigade repertoire: &quot;He's \n\ndesecrated the Holy Ground, ripped apart the Black Velvet Band and sunk \n\nThe Irish Rover with all hands.&quot; Again it is a funny song but with more than \n\nan ounce of truth. \n\n&quot;Welcome Home&quot; reminds us not only of the heartbreak of war but of the fact \n\nthat not only the U.S. had troops fighting in Vietnam. It also reveals the \n\nunseen casualties of war, those whose minds are destroyed and those who are \n\nleft to cope. &quot;Or where hate is muddy quicksand, love is tempered steel, \n\nAnnie waited for his wounds to heal.&quot; &quot;Somewhere in America&quot; recalls the \n\nloneliness of life on the road for a singer as he lives away from wife and \n\nfamily. \n\nListening again to this album I am enjoying the songs but there is a very real \n\nsadness that comes when you look at the notes and why he wrote them. Ten \n\nyears later they could all be written again. \n\n&quot;At Risk&quot; was written about the physical and sexual abuse of children. &quot;Never \n\nAgain&quot; was about the concentration camps of World War II. &quot;Mirrors&quot; reflects \n\non the thousands of &quot;street kids&quot; killed or dying every year. &quot;Don't You Worry \n\nAbout That&quot; is a tale of inflation and recession. \n\nMaybe it is time for this CD to be repackaged and re-issued in the 21st \n\ncentury, maybe then someone will listen to the folksinger. Then again, maybe \n\n-- they never listened before.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/17/eric-bogle/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/17/eric-bogle/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1827ba709a9b1a70248e7cc01c9654c71da80a10","amp;dn":"Eric+Bogle...Mirrors%281993%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1827ba709a9b1a70248e7cc01c9654c71da80a10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,39,186,112,154,155,26,112,36,142,124,192,28,150,84,199,29,168,10,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
