The track features a guest appearance by Neil Finn playing electric guitar.\n\nIn 2004, Higgins released the song &quot;Ten Days&quot; which documented her feelings following a break-up with her boyfriend before she travelled to Europe after leaving high school. Though they later reconciled, the relationship ended and subsequently inspired the lyrics for &quot;Peachy&quot;.The song was written in half an hour at a friend's house where Higgins locked herself in a room with a guitar.She said of the song, &quot;[i]t's all those mind games you play with someone you've just broken up with [...] They're pretending they've moved on; you're pretending you have, too, but neither of you has. It's ridiculous.&quot;\n\nThe song was recorded in 2006 in Los Angeles at producer Mitchell Froom's home studio. The music video was directed by shot by Paul Goodman and Alice Bell.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef3b44d64f2d23cd44eacce70f8bde2fd4173180","amp;dn":"MISSY+HIGGINS+%282008%29+Peachy.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef3b44d64f2d23cd44eacce70f8bde2fd4173180","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,59,68,214,79,45,35,205,68,234,204,231,15,139,222,47,212,23,49,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
