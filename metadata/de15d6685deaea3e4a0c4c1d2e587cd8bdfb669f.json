He became famous in 2006 for his rendition of &quot;De la Rey&quot; by Sean Else and Johan Vorster.\n\nVan Blerk went to HoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«rskool Die Wilgers (school) in Pretoria. After his study, he spent time working abroad.\n\nIn March 2006, Bok van Blerk and the Mossies released the album Jy praat nog steeds my taal (You still speak my language). The same album was rereleased in October 2006 under the name De La Rey and solely credited to Bok van Blerk. According to Van Blerk &quot;and the Mossies&quot; was removed because his fellow singer, Tanya van Graan, was too busy modelling. Van Blerk is accompanied by Jaco Mans (and occasionally Manie van Niekerk) on lead guitar, Francois Coetzee on bass guitar, and Nathan Smit on the drums.\n\nTrack Listing\n\n    1.
