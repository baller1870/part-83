They were formed in 1987. Influenced by such artists as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd, the group combined eastern themes, mysticism and vivid psychedelia with their unique, hard-edged acid-rock.\n\nGroup members were Petri ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPeteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Walli (guitar, vocals), Jukka Jylli (bass) and Sami KuoppamÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ki (drums, percussion). \n\nDuring their existence, Kingston Wall released only three self-financed albums on their own label, Trinity. The albums were Kingston Wall (also known as I) in 1992, II in 1993 and Tri-Logy in 1994.\n\nThe group was disbanded by Petri Walli in December 1994. Walli went travelling to India and Norway. The definite end for Kingston Wall came on June 28th 1995 when Walli jumped to his death from a church tower in Helsinki.\n\nAfter the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s demise, the three Kingston Wall albums have been re-issued as double CDÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s with bonus tracks by Zen Garden record label (Finland). In 2000, a remix album titled Freakout Remixes was released, which featured trance/techno remixes of Kingston Wall songs by Finnish electronica artists, and in autumn 2005 a 3-disc set titled Real Live Thing was released, which featured live bootlegs from various live shows, available now for the first time ever.\n\ntxt from lastfm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d944751e1d89bd8a3f0f8980e1ea3cf96d5cb19f","amp;dn":"Kingston+Wall+-+The+Real+Live+Thing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d944751e1d89bd8a3f0f8980e1ea3cf96d5cb19f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,68,117,30,29,137,189,138,63,15,137,128,225,234,60,249,109,92,177,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
