The commentary is made by Zai, this torrent is created simply for redundancy, if someone wishes to download all the videos via torrent instead of manually on YouTube.\n\nAll copyrights still valid for Blizzard Entertainment, the commentary copyright is owned by Zai, all in all this most likely falls under fair use (commentary) and hopefully Zai does not have a problem with the distribution of the videos in this way. Im just trying to make it easier for people who want all the videos at once.\n\nIf you appreciate the work Zai has put in, please drop him a note at his brothers (Psy) YouTube channel here:\n\n\n[!] Please, if you enjoy these videos, please help seeding them after youre done!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b2416d6d94c1fda4ecf0229fb0796923be66623","amp;dn":"StarCraft+2+Brutal+Campaign+Walkthrough%2C+YouTube+rip+from+the+Ps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b2416d6d94c1fda4ecf0229fb0796923be66623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,36,22,214,217,76,31,218,78,207,2,41,251,7,150,146,59,230,102,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
