Its plot enlarges on Alexander Pushkin's work 'Mozart and Salieri' itself based on rumours recorded in Beethoven's conversation books &amp; current in Vienna at Salieri's death. But this was just the vehicle. Shaffer's great achievement was to conjure up Vienna &amp; Mozart, and to make Mozart's art seem fresh minted.\n\nThis is the National Theatre's production. The Criterion Theatre's production used a slightly different version of the text.\n\nCast\nPaul Scofield\nSimon Callow\nFelicity Kendal\nDonald Gee\nSusan Gilmore\nJohn Normington\nWilliam Sleigh\nWilloughby Goddard\nBasil Henson\nNicholas Selby\nPeggy Marshall\nGlenn Williams\nRobin Meredith\nNigel Bellairs\nAnne Sedgwick\nDermont Crawley\n\nMusic - Kevin Leeman\nNFT Producer - Peter Hall\nRadio Producer - David Spencer\nBroadcast by Radio 3, January 23, 1983\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29387fd080e2f24fa8d503e57bc44266b15329ac","amp;dn":"Amadeus+-+Peter+Shaffer++%28BBC+1983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29387fd080e2f24fa8d503e57bc44266b15329ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,56,127,208,128,226,242,79,168,213,3,229,123,196,66,102,177,83,41,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
