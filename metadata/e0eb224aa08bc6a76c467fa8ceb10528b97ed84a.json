He has released four studio albums, several EPs and singles, as well as a few download-only releases, which include a live album (a recording of his 2005 Bonnaroo performance). He occasionally tours with a full band.\n\nBeam was raised in South Carolina before moving to Florida to attend school and now resides outside of Austin, Texas. The name Iron &amp; Wine is taken from a dietary supplement named &quot;Beef Iron &amp; Wine&quot; that he found in a general store while shooting a film.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_%26_Wine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_%26_Wine&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiss Each Other Clean is the fourth studio album by Iron &amp; Wine, due out January 25, 2011. It's his first album for the Warner Bros. label after leaving Sub Pop. The first track from the album, &quot;Walking Far from Home,&quot; was released on November 26 in CD single and 12&quot; vinyl versions as part of a special Record Store Day Black Friday event and a digital download version was released on November 30. The song &quot;Tree by the River&quot; has also been released, for free download, on Iron &amp; Wine's website. On January 5th Iron and Wine performed all but one song from Kiss Each Other Clean live at the Greene Space in New York City for a live broadcast on NPR's website. The album marks a further change in style. In an interview with SPIN magazine, Beam said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more of a focused pop record. It sounds like the music people heard in their parentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s car growing upÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ that early-to-mid-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s FM, radio-friendly music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Each_Other_Clean&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Each_Other_Clean&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIron &amp; Wine - Kiss Each Other Clean (2011)(ADVANCE)(MP@320)\n\nEXTRA: Iron and Wine - Kiss Each Other Clean Introduction (VIDEO)\n\nTracklist:\n\n01.
