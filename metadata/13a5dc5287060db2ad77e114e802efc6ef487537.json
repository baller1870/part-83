AVRO's &quot;TopPop&quot; was the first weekly pop program broadcast on Dutch television. It ran from September 22, 1970 to June 27, 1988.\n\n&quot;TopPop&quot; was mainly filled with pop artists in the top pop studio, playing to their latest hit. During the years of 1970-1974, 1978-1981 and 1986-1988, the artists were selected by the choice of the Viewer. In the years 1974-1978 and 1981-1986, the National Charts were used instead.\n\n&quot;Such a Shame&quot; is a song written by Mark Hollis for the English band Talk Talk's second album It's My Life (1984).\n\nIt was released as the album's second single in 1984, and became a big hit in continental Europe in 1984 and 1985, reaching the Top 10 in numerous countries, and becoming a number one in certain territories (their second number one single after the remixed version of their song &quot;Talk Talk&quot; which topped the South African charts in 1983); but strangely this single was largely ignored in the UK. In the U.S., the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. &quot;Such a shame&quot; was inspired by The Dice Man, which was one of lyricist Mark Hollis' favourite books. The song was also released in 2004.\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Shame&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Shame&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toppop&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toppop&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EABGbAaDB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EABGbAaDB&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 7700kbps\n   Audio 3: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 224kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:09\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
