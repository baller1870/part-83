ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve been asking for, right?\n\nHow to install PS3 Custom Firmware v3.55\n\n1. Download PS3 Firmware Update (OFW) 3.55\n2. Install (or restore) OFW 3.55\n3. Patch the OFW 3.55 PS3UPDAT.PUP using ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbsdiffÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ / ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbspatchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nbspatch PS3UPDAT.PUP PS3UPDAT-CFW.PUP CFW_v3.55.patch\n\n4. Confirm the resulting PUP has the md5 sum of 6eab7f1deea1ed46a1dc9924fd7080b3\n5. Rename and copy the patched PUP to a USB storage device: /PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP\n6. Flash it from Settings -&gt; System Update (or the Recovery Menu if you need to)\n\nTools will be available on github soon. See README.txt for more info.\n\nUpdate: Uh ohÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Waninkoko speaks up: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDo NOT install in Slim consoles! Looks like users are reporting bricking issues. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s weird as the CFW was tested on both models.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m testing it now. Please standby.\n\nUpdate: Well, on my Slim the installation went a-okay! That said IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve uploaded the patched PUP for you. And I can also confirm that multiMAN, as a Backup Manager, works with no problem. I should mention I updated from geohotÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s jailbreak; I already had multiMAN installed under that (for those wondering why it wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t install under WaninkokoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CFW).\n\nUpdate: There have been many brick reportsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Some fat models, some slimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Many variables come into play when patching LV2. So right now, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like this: If you really, really want backups, then give it a shot, just know the risks involved ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ you could end up with nothing in the end. Otherwise I recommend you buy your games and jailbreak only for homebrew purposes.\n\nDownload:\nPS3 CFW/MFW 3.55 Patch\nPS3 CFW/MFW 3.55 Patched PUP\n\nDisclaimer: Install/flash at your own risk.
