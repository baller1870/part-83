That means a field of Republican Congressmembers poised to helm the 23 House committees and their more than 100 subcommittees. Republicans have already promised a sweeping agenda, including investigating climate scientists, investigating &quot;radicalization&quot; in the Muslim community, and repealing President Obama's healthcare law.

On Saturday, Dilma Rousseff received the presidential sash from outgoing President Lula da Silva at a ceremony in the capital BrasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­lia. In the 1960s, Rousseff was a guerilla resisting Brazil's military dictatorship. She was imprisoned and tortured for three years.

The videos were made in 2006 and 2007 and shown to crew members of the Norfolk-based USS Enterprise during a deployment in the Middle East. The videos feature Captain Owen Honors, who was then the ship's second in charge and is now its top commander.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15c329dbbf813e40d4c41f804cd3b1082bf82f6e","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+03+jan+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15c329dbbf813e40d4c41f804cd3b1082bf82f6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,195,41,219,191,129,62,64,212,196,31,128,76,211,177,8,43,248,47,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
