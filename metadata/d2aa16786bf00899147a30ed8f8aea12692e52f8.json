This was filmed in a September, 2000, concert.\n\nThe girls play up their looks by wearing skimpy clothes, which is a little odd for violin and viola players, but who's complaining? One plays the cello, too. As colorful as the women and the sets are, the attraction is still what it should be: the music. These women may be young - and sound a bit immature when they talk, being nervous in their first big concert, but they can play!\n\nI don't think this group ever recorded any followup concerts for DVD, and I'd like to see how they've progressed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2aa16786bf00899147a30ed8f8aea12692e52f8","amp;dn":"BOND_AT_THE_ROYAL_ALBERT_HALL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2aa16786bf00899147a30ed8f8aea12692e52f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,170,22,120,107,240,8,153,20,122,48,237,143,138,234,18,105,46,82,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
