As is traditional for the band, their costumes were renewed again for the release of this album.\n\nThe first single, This Is Heavy Metal, was released digitally on August 9, 2010, and physically a week later on August 16, 2010. There were only an estimated 200 physical copies of the single made and it is seen as a rare collectors item amongst the Lordi fans.\n\nA limited edition of the album, entitled The Breakfast Box, will include bonus merchandise and is set to be released at October 18, 2010.\n\nThe recording of the album started on February 16, 2010 at WireWorld Studio in Nashville, USA. The band had 44 demos to choose from, of which 15 made the final cut.\n\nLordi is a Finnish hard rock band, which was formed in 1996 by the band's lead singer, songwriter and costume-designer, Mr. Lordi. The band is known for wearing monster masks and using pyrotechnics during concerts.\n\nLordi made history in 2006 by winning the Eurovision Song Contest with a record 292 points, becoming the first Finnish band to win the contest. Lordi was featured on the 2006 MTV Europe Music Awards in Copenhagen when the band's frontman, Mr. Lordi, presented the award for rock. They were also the closing act, playing their single &quot;Hard Rock Hallelujah&quot;. They also performed on Britain's Making Your Mind Up for the Eurovision Song Contest. Lordi performed on the main stage at Ozzfest 2007 and later that year toured with Type O Negative and Twin Method until Halloween night.\n\nLordi was formed in 1996 after Tomi Putaansuu (Mr. Lordi), Jussi SydÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nmaa (Amen) and Sami KeinÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nen (G-stealer) met in Stockholm, where they had gone to see Kiss perform. Though Mr. Lordi already had the idea in 1992. Inspired by Kiss, their vision was to perform with spectacular pyrotechnics and monster masks. In 1997 Erna Siikavirta (Enary) joined the band on keyboard.\n\nIn 1999, the group recorded their first album, Bend Over And Pray The Lord. Tiainen, the owner of their record company, had originally planned to publish the album; however, the company did not have sufficient resources to market it. Tiainen recommended Lordi to the record label Kimmo Hirvonen's Records, owned by Anaconda. The album was never released because Anaconda Records went bankrupt shortly before the planned release date. The band never performed with the original line-up, though they had been promised a record release gig in 1999. During the same year G-Stealer left the band because of work commitments and was replaced by Sami Wolking (Magnum), whom Mr. Lordi had met via Kiss Army Finland. In 2000, drummer Sampsa Astala (Kita) joined LordiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the band had originally planned to use MIDI drum tracks in place of a real drummer.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af334de82a07caa2fdac95cae10da581c31cb09c","amp;dn":"Lordi+-+This+Is+Heavy+Metal+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af334de82a07caa2fdac95cae10da581c31cb09c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,51,77,232,42,7,202,162,253,172,149,202,225,13,165,129,195,28,176,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
