The programme is notable for being one of only a few radio programmes (co)-produced by Douglas Adams while he was employed by the BBC as a radio producer. \n\n\nThe hour-long programme was written by Clive Anderson and Rory McGrath and was co-produced by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd.\n\nThe programme featured performances by:\n\nRichard Baker, Narrator \nTim Brooke-Taylor, Timothenia and the King \nRob Buckman, Prince Charming \nJohn Cleese, Fairy Godperson \nPeter Cook, Prince Disgusting \nGraeme Garden, Gardenia and Manny \nDavid Hatch, himself \nMaggie Henderson, Cinderella \nJo Kendall, Wicked Stepmother \nRichard Murdoch, Baron Oddbeef \nBill Oddie, himself \nJohn Pardoe, Fairy-tale Liberal Prime Minister \n\n\nDouglas Adams had to follow the show's writers to Cambridge in order to get them to work on the script, and had to pick up the finished script from a messenger on a train. Adams also recorded a reluctant John Cleese at home. Cleese had vowed never to work for BBC Radio again, following a dispute over a sketch in the series John Cleese's Sketchbook. \n\nCleese's lines were then played from a tape recorder into the broadcast programme.\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 58mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e59d274d2add35dc046c9e36782519e79684a76a","amp;dn":"Black+Cinderella+Two+Goes+East+-+Audio+Pantomime+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e59d274d2add35dc046c9e36782519e79684a76a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,157,39,77,42,221,53,220,4,108,158,54,120,37,25,231,150,132,167,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
