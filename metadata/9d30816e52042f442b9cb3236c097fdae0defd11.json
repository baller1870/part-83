Newcomers on the scene The Death Notes have already been aptly described as &quot;Siouxsie Sioux fronting the (second album) Horrors&quot; by Mike Joyce from The Smiths. You could also describe them as Kim Gordon fronting The (early 80s) Cure or Mama Cass fronting the Wiggles. Ok, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea. The Death NotesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ frontwoman Elaine is cool as hell with a powerful voice and the rest of the band play dark electronic indie/post punk/goth rock, whatever you want to call it.\n\nTheir latest single ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn the SpiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s WebÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ gets straight to the point with dissonant delay heavy guitar, thundering bass and a creative drum beat that would not sound out of place on a Joy Division album. This is creepy stuff, but it has way too much attitude and swagger to descend into self-pitying pathos. The breakdown is simply divine with the guitar playing a choppy horror movie rhythm reminiscent of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œJawsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ theme. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a clever touch and it really does sound like you have been entangled in a spiderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s web. I love songs that actually sound like their title (even more than I hate songs that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦)! This is the perfect track to make you want to get out your candles and eyeliner and dance around in your room at 3am, if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s your thing. And it definitely is my thing.\n\nReview Score: 9/10&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d30816e52042f442b9cb3236c097fdae0defd11","amp;dn":"The+Death+Notes+-+In+the+Spider%5C%27+s+Web++MP3+320kbs+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d30816e52042f442b9cb3236c097fdae0defd11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,48,129,110,82,4,47,68,43,156,179,35,108,9,127,218,224,222,253,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
