This movie exemplifies how one person in the right place can affect a community of lives. The Adlons seem to express the view that all change and &quot;magic&quot; comes from hard work and mutual acceptance. A well-crafted view of the lives of tourists everywhere and the difficulties they can face. A Whimsical and lovingly Photographed look at the vast wasteland that is too often ignored by much of humanity.&quot;\n\n=========================================================================\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095801/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095801/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f4a177f05f880cb2d185d40e6c2b58144d0e93e","amp;dn":"Out.of.Rosenheim.aka.Bagdad.Cafe.1987+-+dvdrip+-+arabic+subs+har","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f4a177f05f880cb2d185d40e6c2b58144d0e93e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,74,23,127,5,248,128,203,45,24,93,64,230,194,181,129,68,208,233,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
