It demonstrates the potential impact of this unified heart if put into practice by showing the love of God toward others...to not just preach the Good News, but together, to be the Good News.\n\nThe film is part two of a three-part series. While Hillsong United's first film, 'With Hearts As One', was focused on the worship we have within church and words that we proclaim within our music, this second part is about putting those words into action and becoming the hands and feet of Jesus in a world that desperately needs Him. It tells the stories of many across our world and opens up doors for us, not only to understand but to be inspired and to help make a difference.\n\nPlz SEED as long as possible...\n\nUploaded By Abraham","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27ee77e1f235398e656b824b17f41796bbfe4d2","amp;dn":"+The+I+Heart+Revolution+We+are+All+In+This+Together","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27ee77e1f235398e656b824b17f41796bbfe4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,126,231,126,31,35,83,152,230,86,184,36,177,127,65,121,107,191,228,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
