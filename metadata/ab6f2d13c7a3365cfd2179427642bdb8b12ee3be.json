It just had to be an original song - we aren't doing an album of ambient Christmas carols! \n\nWhat we got has astounded us. \nSo we present to you The BFW Christmas Album 2010, a collection of 12 songs with the usual BFW flavour - from ambient to shoegaze to electronic to downright bonkers! \n\nPlease share this album with your family and friends. \n\nMERRY CHRISTMAS! \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bfwrecordings.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bfwrecordings.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6f2d13c7a3365cfd2179427642bdb8b12ee3be","amp;dn":"The+BFW+Christmas+Album+2010+%5Bambient+electronic%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6f2d13c7a3365cfd2179427642bdb8b12ee3be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,111,45,19,199,163,54,92,253,33,121,66,118,66,189,184,177,46,227,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
