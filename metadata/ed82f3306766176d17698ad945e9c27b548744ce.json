Enclosed in that rar file is ANOTHER torrent, which is the actal EWQL Platinum Strings XP. \n\n\n(Sounds complex, huh? Have some pity for the poor uploader, I've spent hours trying to upload this ;D)\n\n\nPlease note that the &quot;XP&quot; stands for &quot;expansion&quot;. This is the EXPANSION for East West's Platinum Strings. \n\nSome sounds will work by themselves, but on the whole, you'll need the original if you want the full working experience with all the .wav samples.\n\nSadly, I can't find a complete seeded torrent of the stand-alone Platinum Edition (all are missing seeders for the 4th DVD), so this'll have to do for now.\n\nTried and tested by yours truly. \n\nHappy composing!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed82f3306766176d17698ad945e9c27b548744ce","amp;dn":"EWQatinum+Strings+Pro+XP+%5BTEAM+DYNAMiCS%5D.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed82f3306766176d17698ad945e9c27b548744ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,130,243,48,103,102,23,109,23,105,138,217,69,233,194,123,84,135,68,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
