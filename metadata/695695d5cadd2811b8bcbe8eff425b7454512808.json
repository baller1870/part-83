There are two tributes to Billy Strayhorn (including a version of &quot;Star Crossed Lovers&quot;), one for George Russell, a remake of &quot;The Crips&quot; and a pair of features for the koto. A very interesting program of adventurous yet quite logical explorations. ~ Scott Yanow\n \nPersonnel:\nJames Newton - flute\nCharles Owens - English horn, soprano sax \nJohn Carter - clarinet\nAllan Iwohara - koto\nRed Callender - tuba\nGreg Martin - oboe\nJohn Nunez - bassoon\nRoberto Miranda - bass\nAnthony Brown - percussion\n\nJames Newton - Water Mystery Tracks:\n01  Star Crossed Lovers\n02  Lone Hill\n03  The Crips\n04  Water Mystery\n05  One For Strayhorn\n06  Dance Steps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:695695d5cadd2811b8bcbe8eff425b7454512808","amp;dn":"James+Newton+-+Water+Mystery+%281985%29+%5Bjazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"695695d5cadd2811b8bcbe8eff425b7454512808","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,86,149,213,202,221,40,17,184,188,190,142,255,66,91,116,84,81,40,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
