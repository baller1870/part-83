Every time I listen to it, I get lost, my mind wandering about, fantasizing about pseudo-orgasmic situations like setting straight all those wackos I've always wanted to tell off. The song &quot;You Wish&quot; carries bulimia as an underlying theme: &quot;she's on her knees in the bathroom...again,&quot; attacking the ideals that our magazine-cover pop-society lashes us with. &quot;Change Your Mind,&quot; a hooky tune, kicks off the CD, while harder-edged songs such as &quot;Yeah, I Know&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want To Be Like You&quot; head straight for your guts. &quot;Hard Candy,&quot; possessing more of a sultry feel, accentuates the fact that Lucky drips hardcore sexuality from its pores. \n\nThe variety of styles on this release, while underscored by anger, incorporate a harmonious aspect throughout. Frontwoman Eleanor Whitledge's vocals have an intense conviction, while guitarist Brad Worrell delivers in fine fashion. His guitar swims aggressively throughout Lucky, giving the CD a rare, honest diversity that retains its street level roots. The production, thankfully, is not over-polished, although it is not as up-front as I had hoped. I guess I'll just have to revel in the universal pleasure of turning it up damn loud and pissing off the people upstairs -- oh well -- and I suggest you do the same. Lucky not only gets the three fingered rock salute, but the middle finger punk salute of approval, too.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a61aa83ce4efb014120558c4e2cd76a3df654a3d","amp;dn":"The+Goops+-+Lucky+%28mp3%40320kbps%29+Gailamir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a61aa83ce4efb014120558c4e2cd76a3df654a3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,26,168,60,228,239,176,20,18,5,88,196,226,205,118,163,223,101,74,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
