These can be modified via Control Panel &gt; [Appearance and Personalization] &gt; Folder Options &gt; click on the View tab, then select the button to show hidden files and folders and also uncheck the box to hide protected operating system files.\n\nThese options can be undone after grabbing the video file from the temporary internet files folder, or left as is if you wish.\n\nI guess that doesn't matter, though, since this is the season finale.
