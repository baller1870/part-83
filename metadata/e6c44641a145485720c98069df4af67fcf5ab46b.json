The Entertainer sees her set the bar high to maintain her place as the most exciting pop/R&amp;B artist in the country. A brilliantly assertive, widescreen pop album, The Entertainer is packed with dancefloor anthems, hook-heavy hits in the making and AleshaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s distinctive deft wordplay and fearlessly powerful vocals. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the sound of an artist finally doing exactly what she wantsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and loving every second of it.\n\nThe Entertainer was preceded by AleshaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s recent hit single, the sassy stomping &quot;Drummer Boy&quot;, which made the nation sit up and take notice with its unmistakable military troop rhythm, shiny brass and synths and irresistible hook. The utterly compelling accompanying video was at one point the most watched music video in the UK on YouTube and was nominated for the MOBO Award for Best Video alongside Mark Ronson, Tinie Tempah, Tinchy Stryder and Dizzee Rascal. Alesha is also heard featuring on the Roll Deep single &quot;Take Control&quot;, and own single &quot;Radio&quot;. All three tracks will be featured on her new album.\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n   1. Baddest Chick\n   2. Radio\n   3. Every Little Part Of Me\n   4.
