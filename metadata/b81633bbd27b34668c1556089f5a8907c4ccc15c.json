In addition to exploring her rich past, the film offers a rare opportunity to experience a century of our history as lived by one inspiring woman. By example, Ruth Ellis shows us what is possible and what can be realized, if one not only lives long and ages well but also lives with pride.\n\nBuy the film at http://sistersincinema.com/filmmakers/ywelbon/ruth_ellis.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81633bbd27b34668c1556089f5a8907c4ccc15c","amp;dn":"Living+with+Pride%3A+Ruth+C.+Ellis+%40+100+%281999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81633bbd27b34668c1556089f5a8907c4ccc15c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,22,51,187,210,123,52,102,140,21,86,8,159,90,137,7,196,204,193,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
