We have done our normal filtering to this of white balance, croma, brightness, along with a few RGB color changes. The audio was from our V1 which was TOXiC's line audio so. The reason for the READNFO is because the other video source is missing more than a few small to large chunks of video, so we had to use cam audio to fill in these areas since TOXiC have not released the full audio yet.\n\ncredit IMAGiNE &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru, greenbud1969 &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7122/4e2979906405.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7122/4e2979906405.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/2096/1943889776ba.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/2096/1943889776ba.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1783/b738998a6f4a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/1783/b738998a6f4a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3019/6815fb1a251f.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/3019/6815fb1a251f.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7083/4a7672952a84.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7083/4a7672952a84.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479997/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479997/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:906887cbcd07ca92690e633e6bd3a26479b5c1db","amp;dn":"Season+Of+The+Witch+TS+XViD+V2+READNFO+-+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"906887cbcd07ca92690e633e6bd3a26479b5c1db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,104,135,203,205,7,202,146,105,14,99,62,107,211,162,100,121,181,193,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
