Among the group is Waldemar (Naschy) the werewolf who \n\n\ngets into a fight with the Yeti. \nThis had an extremely low budget, which I think really helped the film because it's just like those B monster movies from the 1940's. \nThe Yeti looks incredibly stupid but Naschy is quite good in his role and the werewolf look is nice. The Yeti is only used at the start and end of the film, which is a shame but the side plot dealing with Tibet rebels was nicely done.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9075cf6235a9736fb0b96829ac2c802f610dbbf5","amp;dn":"the+wearwolf+and+the+yeti+%28rare+banned+film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9075cf6235a9736fb0b96829ac2c802f610dbbf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,117,207,98,53,169,115,111,176,185,104,41,172,44,128,47,97,13,187,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
