A narration introduces the three Olympians who battled the Titans long ago: the brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes). Hades provided the means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created humans and ruled them while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been deceived by Zeus, was forced to rule the Underworld. Zeus and Poseidon gain power from the prayers of humans, but Hades learns another way: fear.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e66e1569e11a4cb3488ef02b7f8764e09c7de15","amp;dn":"clash+of+the+titans","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e66e1569e11a4cb3488ef02b7f8764e09c7de15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,102,225,86,158,17,164,203,52,136,239,2,183,248,118,78,9,199,222,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
