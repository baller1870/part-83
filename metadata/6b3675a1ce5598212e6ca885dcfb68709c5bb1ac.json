Computer control and automatic location of objects in the night sky is now a feature of even inexpensive astronomical telescopes (under $200), no longer just of the more expensive models. The advantage of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“go-toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ capability is enormous ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the telescope can be aimed at any object in the sky with great speed and accuracy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and so is the popularity of these instruments.\n\nGO-TO Telescopes Under Suburban Skies provides literally hundreds more targets beyond those offered by the built-in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nightly toursÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ that feature on the telescopeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s computer handset (a feature incorporated by most manufacturers). Although most ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“go-toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ telescopes have enormous databases of objects they can find ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ usually running into tens of thousands ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the tours (thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s suggested objects to look at) are always very limited. Once youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve seen the planets and bright objects that the computer suggests, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re on your ownÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nThis new book answers the question, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“What shall I observe next?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ in a way that is unique to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“go-toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ telescopes. Unlike all existing books on deep sky observing, GO-TO Telescopes Under Suburban Skies doesn't waste space on RA/Dec co-ordinates or Star Maps and Finder Charts for suggested objects. It is designed expressly to be used alongside a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“go-toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ telescope, using the NGC and SAO menus on the computer handset to quickly slew the telescope to each new target. This is unique, and makes the book much more information-rich than other observing guides.\n\nTargets are arranged by season to maximise the chances of a given object being visible at the time of observing, and then are divided into four categories: three deep sky categories of increasing difficulty, and then one category of stars that covers things like coloured stars, multiple stars, and loose clusters/streams. The reader can quickly turn to the relevant season, and then work through the list of objects.\n\nAll existing books about practical deep-sky observing are biased towards non-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“go-toÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ telescope owners and usually assume large-aperture instruments and/or dark, rural or desert skies. This book makes the more realistic assumption that the amateur astronomer has a relatively small telescope and is observing from a backyard in a suburban area.\n\nInstead of devoting page after page to maps and co-ordinates, GO-TO Telescopes Under Suburban Skies leaves the computer to locate targets by using NGC and SAO catalog numbers, and so has the space to suggest many more fascinating deep-sky targets and provide detailed observing lists and information about what's being viewed.
