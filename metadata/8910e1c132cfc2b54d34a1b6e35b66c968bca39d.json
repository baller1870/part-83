Get a futz.me account. Say your account name is : &quot;XXX&quot;\n\na.) Your new futz.me public page is: futz.me/xxx\nb.) To send text to that page type: futz.me/xxx/p blablabla\nc.) Your new futz.me public page rss is: futz.me/xxx/rss\n\n2.) Ok, now you have your futz.me account. Open up uTorrent, and go do &quot;Add RSS Feed&quot; on the left. Paste in futz.me/xxx/rss. Check to &quot;automatically download all items in feed&quot;.\n\n...That's it!\n\n\nNow to USE it:\n\n1.) Find a torrent page you like. And put your futz.me public page in front of it.\nLike this: futz.me/xxx/p http://thepiratebay.se/blablala\n\n2.) That's it! Your utorrent will start downloading it.\n\nThis works for PB, Demonoid, KickAss, andfor now.\n\nFor use with legal torrents only of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE ON THE SONG ITSELF:\n\nAnother far out blast from the past, this is one of the biggest hit songs from the WW1 era. Nothing has really changed much, in the human heart since then. But the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has changed somewhat! Great song, great playing, marvelous singing, and how did they get such a good recording back then? ProTools has nothing on a nice old reel to reel, and a band that can actually play.\n\nThis file was taken from: http://www.publicdomain2ten.com/2009/09/albert-farrington-its-a-long-way-to-tipperary-mp3/\n\nAs far as I know it is 100% legal and public domain to post this.
