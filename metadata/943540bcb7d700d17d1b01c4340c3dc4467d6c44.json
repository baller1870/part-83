Four ugly little wasters and one ugly lanky waster. We hit things, strum things, pluck things and pull faces. My mate Rich heard it and said it was alright. To put it bluntly, The Butch Birds are the musical equivalent of a bee stapling dogs bollocks to it's knees. Listening to, and watching us is like sharing Rolos with Moses. Could this be the the ultimate party band? Who knows? Don't answer that... Chumps.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:943540bcb7d700d17d1b01c4340c3dc4467d6c44","amp;dn":"up+the+butch+birds+-+bootleg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"943540bcb7d700d17d1b01c4340c3dc4467d6c44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,53,64,188,183,215,0,209,125,27,1,196,52,12,61,196,70,125,108,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
