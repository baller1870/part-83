Czech director Petr Weigl specialized in this technique; most of his work suffers from an overblown eroticism, but in this case it perfectly fits the story. I find this version more satisfying than filmed stage performances. I don't always feel that way - I find Helen Field's (staged) Turn of the Screw better than Weigl's, or any of the genuine movies... I'll post it some day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1bb852d1be30d026d3eb5d9e0fd46592e53e16","amp;dn":"Lady+Macbeth+of+Mtsensk%28Weigl%29+Hrubesova+Shostakovich+Lip-synch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b1bb852d1be30d026d3eb5d9e0fd46592e53e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,27,184,82,209,190,48,208,38,211,235,93,158,15,212,101,146,229,62,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
