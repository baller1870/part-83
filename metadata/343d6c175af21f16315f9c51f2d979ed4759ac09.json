Mountain Country\n11. Your Love\n\n\n\nIt would be extraordinarily difficult to find a more charismatic performer on the gig circuit than Tim Ten Yen at the moment. Endearingly awkward in his baggy suits, he nevertheless performs solo and even attempts dance routines. He is also an unashamed and bold romantic. Sparkly opener, 'Girl Number One', is a good example. With a dreamy opening, the narrative describes meeting said girl, hints at the relationship ensuing and problems arising (giving a &quot;girl&quot; a number possibly being one of them). One suspects that Tim falls easily in love. Again, and again. 'When the Song Applies to You' is almost unbearably fluffy. TTY is nothing if not a true pop aficionado. Self referential too: the chorus goes, &quot;now I know what it means when the song applies to you/Now I know how it feels when the song applies to me. \nThis is an album almost overloaded with listener-pleasing pop. Who could criticise that?&quot;\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/26/tim-ten-yen/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/26/tim-ten-yen/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:343d6c175af21f16315f9c51f2d979ed4759ac09","amp;dn":"Tim+Ten+Yen...Everything+Beautiful+Reminds+Me+of+You%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"343d6c175af21f16315f9c51f2d979ed4759ac09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,61,108,23,90,242,31,22,49,95,156,81,242,217,121,237,71,89,172,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
