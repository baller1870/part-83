Karl gives some predictions on the US economy in the New Year. He is downbeat and forecasts a terrible year for the housing, banking and myriad of sectors. He says the Europe would also disintegrate and says people there will have a weaker euro in parity with the dollar. China will also break the peg and people would see a rise in commodity price, bubble assets and less export to the US. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://market-ticker.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://market-ticker.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.\n\nYou can watch the video at these links:\n\npart 1 of 3\n\npart 2 of 3\n\npart 3 of 3\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
