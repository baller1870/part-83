HereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢'s hoping that Katshi-koshi happens for those worthy!  For those who actually read the description here, could you all please let me know which files you have been downloading?  Just a comment saying MPG or AVI.  This is just for the purpose of a poll: I'm not going to change next BashoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢'s upload style- still going with the same 5 files.\nFile Folder contains;\n-Kyushu.Basho.day.15.E.mpg\tOriginal English broadcast *.mpg\n-Kyushu.Basho.day.15.N.mpg\tOriginal Japanese broadcast *.mpg\n-Kyushu.Basho.day.15.avi\tDual Language *.avi (use VLC media player for best results)\n-Kyushu.day.15.docx\t\tthis description, in a document\n-Torrent downloaded from *emonoid.com.txt\t\tadvertising!\n\nChoose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) that I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (for faster DL).  \n\nTo those who haven't downloaded from me before, there ALWAYS seems to be a speed issue in the beginning.  I am on the ass-end of the internet and my provider also caps the speed to different nodes throughout the world.  That's the way it is.\n\nSee you next Basho!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/index.html&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Bum_Fluff\nhttp://www.*emonoid.com/users/bumfluff42\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575451ecaacf12cdf7f831fb8415a9dc81759f11","amp;dn":"SUMO+Kyushu+Basho-+Day+15+-+Nov+2010+%28Xvid-AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575451ecaacf12cdf7f831fb8415a9dc81759f11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,84,81,236,170,207,18,205,247,248,49,251,132,21,169,220,129,117,159,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
