If standup superstars are what you're after, look no further: here's Dane Cook. You'd like a little musical comedy? Australian trio Axis of Awesome explain how ubiquitous the four-chord composition is (much funnier than it sounds here). Another spin on international comedy: Des Bishop is a Brooklyn-born, Dublin-living comic. Haven't seen many hilarious women recently? May we suggest the bubbly Maryellen Hooper. Some American television fare? Witness Nick Cannon aka Mr. Mariah Carey (and host of America's Got Talent). Enough with the standup, what you are really in the mood for is ventriloquism. Take a bite out of talentedPaul Zerdin. And for dessert, get a load of gravel-voiced married scaredycat Canadian Mike Wilmot, and the piÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨ce de rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©sistance of relationship comedy: Pete Correale.\n\nFile Information\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 352 MiB for 45mn 0s 224ms\nSource            : CBC HD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 953 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:65dd2eba4c368e2a815307e8274ef8859ebb0484","amp;dn":"Just+for+Laughs.Show+No.7.15.Nov.2010.PDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"65dd2eba4c368e2a815307e8274ef8859ebb0484","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,221,46,186,76,54,142,42,129,83,7,232,39,78,248,133,158,187,4,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
