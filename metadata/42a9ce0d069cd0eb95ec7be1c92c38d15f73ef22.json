Then he went on his journey. 16 The man who had received five bags of gold went at once and put his money to work and gained five bags more. 17 So also, the one with two bags of gold gained two more. 18 But the man who had received one bag went off, dug a hole in the ground and hid his master's money.\n\n   19 &quot;After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them. 20 The man who had received five bags of gold brought the other five. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with five bags of gold. See, I have gained five more.'\n\n   21 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   22 &quot;The man with two bags of gold also came. 'Master,' he said, 'you entrusted me with two bags of gold; see, I have gained two more.'\n\n   23 &quot;His master replied, 'Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master's happiness!'\n\n   24 &quot;Then the man who had received one bag of gold came. 'Master,' he said, 'I knew that you are a hard man, harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 So I was afraid and went out and hid your gold in the ground. See, here is what belongs to you.'\n\n   26 &quot;His master replied, 'You wicked, lazy servant! So you knew that I harvest where I have not sown and gather where I have not scattered seed? 27 Well then, you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers, so that when I returned I would have received it back with interest.\n\n   28 &quot;'So take the bag of gold from him and give it to the one who has ten bags. 29 For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. 30 And throw that worthless servant outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nI am so tired of hearing this nonsense go back and forth, over and over again...\n\n&quot;This is better...

Every one of my files, come from my personal Library, to archive in the hands of my brethren, such that they flourish, and realize the divine craftsmanship of Almighty God, in turn plant ALL the seed of their yield, never knowing who is the next Michelangelo or Beethoven, nor would that opportunity ever befall them, should the work of YOUR own hands fail God's divine will...\n\nThere is an encryption, in the Bible, such that, if YOU try to stand between ME and New Jerusalem, I come armed with the Armor of God...\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\nEphesians 6:10-20\n\nThe Armor of God\n\n 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord\n and in his mighty power.\n\n 11 Put on the full armor of God,\n so that you can take your stand against the devilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s schemes.\n\n 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood,\n but against the rulers,\n against the authorities,\n against the powers of this dark world\n and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.\n\n 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God,\n so that when the day of evil comes,\n you may be able to stand your ground,\n and after you have done everything,\n to stand.\n\n 14 Stand firm then,\n with the belt of truth buckled around your waist,\n with the breastplate of righteousness in place,\n\n 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.\n\n 16 In addition to all this,\n take up the shield of faith,\n with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.\n\n 17 Take the helmet of salvation\n and the sword of the Spirit,\n which is the word of God. \n\n 18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests.\n With this in mind,\n be alert and always keep on praying for all the LordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s people.\n\n 19 Pray also for me,\n that whenever I speak,\n words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,\n\n 20 for which I am an ambassador in chains.\n Pray that I may declare it fearlessly,\n as I should.\n\n\n###################################################################################\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrents.thepiratebay.se/6137527/Deepwater_Crimes_Against_Humanity_-_Endurance_Manuals.6137527.TPB.torrent&lt;/a&gt;\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKaspersky - Internet Security 2011 (Lifetime Fail Safe)\n_______________________________________________________\n\n\nNow, let's get down to business...\n\nWhat is contained in this torrent are three versions of the application, and three methodologies of the solution...\n\nThese are given in order of installation precedence, however, should you choose to utilize them, is at your discretion...\n\nThe first, by which it must be mentioned, that THIS is your LEAST preferred method, yet it MUST be installed first, should you choose to utilize it at a later date...\n\nSuch that, if you follow these instructions, you will have all three options available at a moment's notice, under all possible conditions...\n\n\nThis whole thing became an issue, when the &quot;242.Kaspersky - Internet Security 2011 - [10 Year License Key]&quot; had the &quot;carpet pulled out from underneath it&quot; just recently...\n\nBefore that, you would have been licensed for 3700 days...\n\nSuffice it to say, those who wish to pursue the repair of such a solution, may wish to give it consideration for future releases...\n\nHere, I will explain and offer these three methodologies as a &quot;Lifetime Fail Safe&quot; solution...\n\n\nTo begin, what is known as the &quot;Trial Resetter&quot;, is exactly as it sounds...  It's a small applet that, in order to EVER be used, must be injected during the Installation Process, but before the Activation Process...  The result of which allows the user to reinitiate the file, and subsequently reset the &quot;Trial Period&quot; for Kaspersky back to &quot;30-Days&quot;...\n\nSecondly, the &quot;10 Year License Key&quot;...  Until a couple weeks ago, this file would &quot;Activate&quot; Kaspersky for 3700 days without exception...  Alas, they pulled the carpet out from underneath it, by restricting directory permissions surrounding the file &quot;fltlib.dll&quot;, and thus disabling the effect of the &quot;10 Year License Key&quot; upon system reboot...  However (upon reinitiation), the &quot;10 Year License Key&quot; is your ONLY &quot;Fail Safe&quot;, as it does NOT require Internet access, nor authentication...\n\nWhich brings us to the &quot;Blacklist Keys&quot;...  These are a &quot;God Send&quot;, and EXTREMELY USEFUL, but they come at a cost...  Namely, the &quot;Blacklist Keys&quot; are &quot;handmade&quot;, by a &quot;handful&quot; of people...  TO WHICH YOU MUST OFFER YOUR RESPECT AND GRATITUDE...!!!  However, they STILL must be &quot;created&quot;, which leads to &quot;downtime&quot;...\n\n\nTo summarize...  The &quot;Blacklist Keys&quot; are your first choice if they are available, and will remain active upon reboot, until the company &quot;Kaspersky Labs&quot; identifies them, at which point they are disabled, and the user must attain a new &quot;Blacklist Key&quot;...\n\nThe &quot;10 Year License Key&quot; is your 100% Fail Safe, that can be initiated WITHOUT internet access, REMAINS active for the duration that the computer is booted, is completely updatable, and is completely &quot;transparent&quot;, such that the user DOES NOT receive ANY &quot;Trial Notification&quot; nag, like the &quot;Trial Resetter&quot; produces EVERY 5 minutes...\n\nLast on the list, is the &quot;Trial Resetter&quot;...  All of the methodologies work and are solid solutions, however I (personally) can't stand the &quot;Trial Resetter&quot;...  Aside from &quot;TROLLS&quot;, it's one of the more annoying nags on the Planet...  I would MUCH RATHER use the &quot;Blacklist Keys (if available)&quot;, or the &quot;10 Years License Key (upon system reboot)&quot;, simply so I don't have to see that fucking &quot;Trial Version Nag&quot; EVERY 5 MINUTES...\n\nI would much rather (if I had to), use the &quot;10 Year License Key&quot;, and consider it as a &quot;60 Second Nag&quot; to re-initiate the process upon every system reboot, for a fully functioning, completely updatable, non-authenticating, &quot;Top-Shelf&quot; Antivirus and Firewall solution...\n\n\nNow, I'm tired and out of breath, so let's get this Show on the Road...\n\nHowever, I want you to understand, that if THIS torrent gets pulled down, it's because I'm &quot;under attack&quot; by Trolls, and THEY don't want YOU to have THIS torrent, because it makes THEM look incompetent...  Thus, they will attack the integrity of this file, (or myself) to cause &quot;doubt&quot; in your mind, such that THEY would redirect your attention from HERE, to whichever malicious direction THEY COULD DECEIVE YOU to following...\n\nBefore you &quot;Trust a Troll&quot;, verify that they HAVE EVER contributed a fucking thing to &quot;progress&quot;...\n\n\nI'm working for God and Jesus, and if you trust in my word, I will meet you in New Jerusalem...\n\n\n\n###################################################################################\n\n THESE WORK COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT FROM EACH OTHER, BUT THIS WOULD BE THEIR ORDER\n\n###################################################################################\n\n\n\nWALKTHROUGH [Trial Resetter]\n____________________________\n\n\n001)  Launch application of your choice...\n\n\t-  242.Kaspersky - Internet Security 2011 - [11.0.0.232].exe\n\t-  242.Kaspersky - Internet Security 2011 - [11.0.0.400].exe\n\t-  242.Kaspersky - Internet Security 2011 - [11.0.2.556].exe\n\n002)  Enable checkbox 'Change installation settings'...\n\n003)  Click [Next]...\n\n004)  Click [I agree]...\n\n005)  Disable checkbox 'I accept the terms of participation in Kaspersky Security Network'...\n\n006)  Click [Next]...\n\n007)  Set destination folder 'C:\\Program Files\\Kaspersky Lab\\Kaspersky Internet Security 2011\\'...\n\n008)  Click [Next]...\n\n009)  Enable checkbox 'Protect the installation process'...\n\n010)  Click [Install]...\n\n011)  (Demonstrate patience while waiting for installation to complete...)\n\n012)  (Demonstrate patience while waiting for installation to complete...)
