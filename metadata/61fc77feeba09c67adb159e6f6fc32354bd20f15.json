Charlie works for his uncle Giovanni (who is the local mafia caporegime), mostly collecting debts. He is also having a hidden affair with Johnny Boy's cousin, Teresa, who has epilepsy and is ostracized because of her condition - especially by Charlie's uncle. A major figure in the plot is the conflict between Charlie's devout Catholicism and his Mafia ambitions. As the film progresses, Johnny becomes increasingly self-destructive and disrespects his creditors more and more. Unable to feel redeemed by his actions in church, Charlie finds redemption through self-sacrifice on Johnny's behalf, long after it ceases to be reasonable or deserved.\n\nEdition Details:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Commentary by Martin Scorsese and Amy Robinson\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Vintage Featurette: Back on the Block\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Theatrical Trailer\n\n\nMany Thanks To Marckymarc.....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61fc77feeba09c67adb159e6f6fc32354bd20f15","amp;dn":"Mean+Streets+%281973%29+NTSC+DVD9+ISO%2BMDS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61fc77feeba09c67adb159e6f6fc32354bd20f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,252,119,254,235,160,156,103,173,177,89,230,246,252,50,53,75,210,15,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
