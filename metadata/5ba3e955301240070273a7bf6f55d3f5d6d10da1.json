Balthazar can't do it alone, so he recruits Dave Stutler (Jay       \n Baruchel), a seemingly average guy who demonstrates hidden potential, as     \n his reluctant protÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“gÃƒÅ½Ã‹Å“. The sorcerer gives his unwilling accomplice a crash   \n course in the art and science of magic, and together, these unlikely         \n partners work to stop the forces of darkness. It'll take all the courage     \n Dave can muster to survive his training, save the city and get the girl as   \n he becomes The Sorcerer's Apprentice.                                        \n                                                                              \n\n--------==========----------\nHappy Hacker Industries \n\nJust a group of friends who believe in quality Audio/Video rips.\nThese rips are made from retail DVD and audio CDs.
