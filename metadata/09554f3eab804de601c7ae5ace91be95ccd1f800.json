The group originally formed in 1983 and despite several bassists and drummers coming and going (including future Black Sabbath and Great White bass player Dave Spitz), the group managed to issue a debut, Fight to Survive, on the independent metal label Grand Slamm in 1984. With Tramp's pinup good looks and Bratta's Eddie Van Halen-esque six-string work, the group seemed destined for success (especially with such similarly styled outfits as MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶tley CrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼e and Ratt storming the charts), but it would be several years before their next album would appear. Finally finding the right rhythm section (bassist James LoMenzo and former Anthrax drummer Greg d'Angelo), White Lion inked a major-label recording contract with Atlantic, issuing Pride in 1987.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tFlac 1.2.1\nEncoder Settings:\tHigh\t\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tAtlantic\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Lights And Thunder\n02.Broken Heart\n03.Leave Me Alone\n04.Love Don't Come Easy\n05.You're All I Need\n06.It's Over\n07.Warsong\n08.She's Got Everything\n09.Till Death Do Us Part\n10.Out With The Boys\n11.Blue Monday\n12.Farewell To You\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09554f3eab804de601c7ae5ace91be95ccd1f800","amp;dn":"White+Lion+-+Mane+Attraction+%281991%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09554f3eab804de601c7ae5ace91be95ccd1f800","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,85,79,62,171,128,77,230,1,199,174,90,206,145,190,149,204,209,248,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
