Having already been influenced by his firefighter father's latent racism, Derek is driven to action when his father is shot and killed while fighting a fire in a suspected Compton drug den. Eventually Derek becomes second-in-command of a neo-Nazi street gang, The D.O.C., and entices young whites to join. The gang commits acts of intimidation, such as damaging a store owned by a Korean and challenging black players to basketball games to win the court as turf. These incidents go unnoticed by the family until Derek has an argument (involving Rodney King) with his mother's friend Murray who is Jewish. Later that night while Derek is having sex with his girlfriend Stacey (Fairuza Balk), Danny informs Derek that three black men are attempting to steal Derek's dad's truck. Derek runs outside and shoots at the two of the men with a pistol, killing the first one instantly who he shoots in the chest. The second man, one of the black basketball players, Derek shoots and wounds and a mad Derek vows to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot; for trying to steal the truck his father gave him and forces him to put his mouth on the curb, then brutally kills him with a curb-stomp. Danny watches in horror as this unfolds. The police arrest Derek as he smiles at a shocked Danny.\n\nRelease date: October 23, 1998\n\nFile size: 2.27GB\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120586/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120586/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Crime Drama\nCast:\n\n# Edward Norton as Derek Vinyard\n# Edward Furlong as Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; Vinyard\n# Beverly D'Angelo as Doris Vinyard\n# Avery Brooks as Dr. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Sweeney\n# Stacy Keach as Cameron Alexander\n# Jennifer Lien as Davina Vinyard\n# Fairuza Balk as Stacey\n# Elliott Gould as Murray\n\n\n\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC(.mp4)\nVideo Codec Type: X264\nAverage video bitrate: 2 500 Kbps\nMaximum video bitrate: 11.5 Mbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 740x320\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.422\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: American.History.X.1080p.X264.Blu-ray.JUGGALOTUS420\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 363 Kbps Variable\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels\n\nNOTE\nWe are searching for good encoders.Contact us if you wish to be in our gang!\nWe are always searching for new affliates,dedicated servers and early sources.You are most welcome if you can provide them.\nIf you like our encodes,keep them alive!\nGREETZ: DarkScene,Hawkseye,Noir,SceneUG,TheFalcon007,SUDesigner,HDScene Encoders,,TorrentState,Kingdom RG,MnM-RG,HDLiTE,UKB-KvCD,Movie-Torrentz,AhaShare,Torrent-Force RG,Fastline RG,1337x,Resource RG,ExtraTorrent RG,DDR all SceneUG releasers and Uploaders and all other p2p release groups out there!\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img602.imageshack.us/img602/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img602.imageshack.us/img602/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img32.imageshack.us/img32/615/americanhistxhdsrelease.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccfc70c0ccee32cd82f7aadd4bc797b1342557d0","amp;dn":"American+History.X+BRrip+X264+AAC+480p+vice%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccfc70c0ccee32cd82f7aadd4bc797b1342557d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,252,112,192,204,238,50,205,130,247,170,221,75,199,151,177,52,37,87,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
