The tracks collected here offer up a musical ambience that accurately depicts time and place with classic selections from acknowledged area kingpins Frank Stokes, Furry Lewis, Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers, Memphis Minnie, Joe McCoy and Jack Kelly. Like its companion volume, this 20 track compilation is mastered direct from extremely rare old 78s-in some cases, the only copies known to exist-and the sound varies wildly from track to track. But the music is so great and of such major historical significance, the 78 surface noise that remains only seems to add to the charm and romance of it all. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22f8af1d2aa899c2aa0081204010b07ee6336ae","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+%5BVA%5D++Memphis+Masters+-+Early+American+Blues+1927-34","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22f8af1d2aa899c2aa0081204010b07ee6336ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,47,138,241,210,170,137,156,42,160,8,18,4,1,11,7,238,99,54,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
