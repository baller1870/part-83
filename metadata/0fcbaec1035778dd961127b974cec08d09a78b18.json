When Boog accidentally finds out that Elliot won't be accompanying him, he gets in a mood and decides to take the journey alone. Boog's lone adventure leads him to the circus where he runs into another bear called Doug who is a little scruffier than Boog but the two look incredibly similar. With Boog longing to belong and Doug wishing to be free, the two decide to switch places, but Doug forgets to tell Boog that this isn't a temporary proposal and the circus will be returning to Russia.\n\nAs Boog starts to learn new circus routines, Doug journeys to the woods masquerading as Boog but it doesn't take long for Elliot to realise that Boog is acting drastically differently and when Doug informs him of Boogs new profession and that he'll be sent to Russia, a rescue mission is implemented and the gang set out to save their buddy. \n\n\n[img]http://leetleech.org/images/95521316153253938506.png[/img]\n\n\n[img]http://img819.imageshack.us/img819/4126/snapshotq.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/6294/snapshot2uo.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://img813.imageshack.us/img813/7346/snapshot4i.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\nSOURCE: RETAIL BLURAY\n\n\nGreetz to Fabreezy ,Imagine ,Flawl3ss ,Santi ,Vision ,Kingdom,BDK,DiGiTALiNK,LEGION,Classified,WBZ and to all who share[/center]\n\n\n[center][img]http://signatures.mylivesignature.com/54488/364/63C91F8D3F952BFA8B83650965539EC2.png[/img]\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fcbaec1035778dd961127b974cec08d09a78b18","amp;dn":"Open+Season+3+2010+XVID+BRRIP+SAFCuk009%2BFabreezy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fcbaec1035778dd961127b974cec08d09a78b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,203,174,193,3,87,120,221,150,17,39,185,116,206,192,141,9,167,139,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
