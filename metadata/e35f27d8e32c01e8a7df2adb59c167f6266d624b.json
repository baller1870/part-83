It's probably only low-TV-quality, but it is a glimpse into the supreme court as it makes an importan decision on the future of the internet in Canada.\n\nWayne Crookes has attempted to sue, in this series, Google, BC public libraries, Yahoo, Wikipedia and a plethora of bloggers across the political spectrum for the action of linking to information of him.\n\n&quot;It seems to me that if we accept the position youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re putting forth [Crookes' lawyer] , then no one should ever hyperlink.
