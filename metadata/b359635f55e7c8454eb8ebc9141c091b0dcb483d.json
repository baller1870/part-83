The French title refers to the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, around which the story is centered.\n\nThe story dates back to January 6, 1482 in Paris, France, the day of the 'Festival of Fools' in Paris. Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer of Notre Dame, is introduced by his crowning as Pope of Fools.\n\nEsmeralda, a beautiful Gypsy with a kind and generous heart, captures the hearts of many men, including that of a Captain Phoebus, but especially those of Quasimodo and his adopted father, Claude Frollo, the Archdeacon of Notre Dame. Frollo is torn between his lust and the rules of the church. He orders Quasimodo to kidnap her, but the hunchback is suddenly captured by Phoebus and his guards who save Esmeralda. Quasimodo is sentenced to be whipped and ordered to be tied down by the heat. Esmeralda, seeing his thirst, offers him water. It saves her, for she captures his heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/hunchback_of_notre_dame__the.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/hunchback_of_notre_dame__the.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCast:\nQuasimodo - David Bower\nesmerelda - .candis nergaard\nfrollo....kevin doyle\ngeorge....garry robson\nguillaume....Terence Mann\ndirected by Polly Thomas\nguillaume....Terence Mann\nguillaume....Terence Mann\ndirected by Polly Thomas\nmadame la fayette....rita may\nmadame poutine....susan twist\nmikael leduc....roger morlidge\nphoebus....Joseph Kloska\nquasimodo....david bower\nesmerelda....candis nergaard\nfrollo....kevin doyle\nmadame poutine....susan twist\nmadame la fayette....rita may\nphoebus....Joseph Kloska\nmikael leduc....roger morlidge\ngeorge....garry robson\nguillaume....Terence Mann\ndirected by Polly Thomas\nphoebus....Joseph Kloska\n\n\nThe Hunchback Of Notre Dame\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 112mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b359635f55e7c8454eb8ebc9141c091b0dcb483d","amp;dn":"The+Hunchback+Of+Notre+Dame+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b359635f55e7c8454eb8ebc9141c091b0dcb483d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,89,99,95,85,231,200,69,78,184,235,201,20,28,9,27,13,203,72,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
