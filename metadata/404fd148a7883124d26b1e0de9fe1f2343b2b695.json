SCUNT went through 3 singers &amp; 10,000 cases of beer but only played 1 show. A debut was booked with GG Allin, then canceled. Another one with Poison Idea fell through. Finally in \\\\\\'89, SCUNT opened at The Rat for other_bands. Adrian [God Rest His Soul] wrote 2 fantastic songs, then proceeded to be a completely useless piece of shit. He held his dick until Dee &amp; Matty threw him out of their apartment and out of the band. Paul came in as the next singer. He was talented and had lots of energy. He also had a job and splitting a practice studio with Wrecking Crew meant $$. Everyone got on well but Paul was straightedge and the rest of SCUNT were shitfaced more often than not. Paul decided to leave. Then came Tod up from Pennsylvania. He drank but was responsible enough to front the band (yet not enough to give a tape to the sound guy at the one &amp; only gig). He sings on the tape. Summer \\\\\\'89: Matty broke his hand at a party on Thayer Street. No one was interested in waiting for the cast to come off, so they said fuck it.\n\nYears later, a crappy cassette from a tape deck in the practice space turned up, so this is it.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404fd148a7883124d26b1e0de9fe1f2343b2b695","amp;dn":"Scunt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404fd148a7883124d26b1e0de9fe1f2343b2b695","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,79,209,72,167,136,49,36,210,107,30,13,233,254,31,35,67,178,182,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
