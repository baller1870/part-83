Really cute episode with great new songs as the two teams race across the savannah to see who will end up with the elephant.\n\nThe Magic Skateboard\nTyrone really wants to be a great skateboarder. He may not know all the tricks yet, but once he finds the magic skateboard, he's going to compete in the Show-Off Showdown.\n\nThe Flipper\nUniqua, Tasha and Pablo are the Meteor Watch Squad. But when meteor-obsessed Pablo accidentally spills toxic space goo all over himself, he becomes the super strong, super excitable Flipper!\n\nSuper Team Awesome\nTyrone is a tour guide for the world's only lava geyser, Old Gushie. When a loose boulder in the cavern threatens to cause a geothermal disaster, Tyrone calls for help. Not one, but three superheroes come to save the day!
