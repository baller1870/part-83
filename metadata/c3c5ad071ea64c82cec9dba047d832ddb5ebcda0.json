This gritty solo collection of 11 songs is recorded in the spirit of the 20ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and 50ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blues masters. It covers the road from Mississippi to Chicago in a stirring tribute to the roots of the music that has driven pop music for decades. With a bourbon stained voice that sounds as if it could be coming through the torn radio speaker of a 1927 Buick, Lucky Room was recorded on vintage acoustic and electric guitars and amplifiers. Close your eyes and you will find yourself sitting at a table in a juke joint, somewhere along Highway 61.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3c5ad071ea64c82cec9dba047d832ddb5ebcda0","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Rick+Taylor+-+Lucky+Room","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3c5ad071ea64c82cec9dba047d832ddb5ebcda0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,197,173,7,30,166,76,130,206,201,219,160,71,216,50,221,181,235,205,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
