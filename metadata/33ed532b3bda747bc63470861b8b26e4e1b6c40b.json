McDonaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s loved using the UK libel laws to suppress criticism. Major media organizations like the BBC and The Guardian crumbled and apologized.\n\nBut then they sued gardener Helen Steel and postman Dave Morris. In the longest trial in English legal history, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMcLibel TwoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ represented themselves against McDonaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£10 million legal team. Every aspect of the corporationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s business was cross-examined: from junk food and McJobs, to animal cruelty, environmental damage and advertising to children.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Dave brought up his young son alone and Helen supported herself working nights in a bar. McDonaldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tried every trick in the book against them. Legal maneuvers. A visit from Ronald McDonald. Top executives flying to London for secret settlement negotiations. Even spies.\n\nSeven years later, in February 2005, the marathon legal battle finally concluded at the European Court of Human Rights. And the result took everyone by surprise ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ especially the British Government. McLibel is not just about hamburgers. It is about the importance of freedom of speech now that multinational corporations are more powerful than countries.\n\n\nWatch online:http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/mclibel/\n\nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33ed532b3bda747bc63470861b8b26e4e1b6c40b","amp;dn":"McLibel+-+Two+People+Who+Never+Said+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%CB%9CSorry%5C%27++2005++BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33ed532b3bda747bc63470861b8b26e4e1b6c40b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,237,83,43,59,218,116,123,198,52,112,134,27,139,38,228,225,182,196,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
