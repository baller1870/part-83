Being a fishing enthusiast myself, I thought it was worth sharing. This is the second in the series, hence the title, Fishing Music II.\n\nThe CD includes 16 songs, encompassing genres from bluegrass to swing, jazz, and blues. Despite the music diversity of the songs, the CD does have a cohesive feel since all 16 songs are about fishing, fish, and rivers.\n\nBeing from the northwestern part of the country, producers Ben Winship and David Thompson share an interest in fly fishing, so youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find many themes here from that sport.\n\nIn addition to the two producers, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also hear among the guest musicians, bluegrass artists: Mike Dowling, Tim &amp; Mollie OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Brien, Rob Ickes, John Lowell, Andy Hall, Aoife OÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢Donovan, and Brian Wicklund.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/23/ben-winship/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/23/ben-winship/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95a42dabf39f0c009d4f3bb782ecceeddac4301e","amp;dn":"Ben+Winship...Fishing+Music+II%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95a42dabf39f0c009d4f3bb782ecceeddac4301e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,164,45,171,243,159,12,0,157,79,59,183,130,236,206,237,218,196,48,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
