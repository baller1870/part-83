Babs  \n\nS.O.B.&quot; (in the film) stands for &quot;Standard Operational Bullshit&quot; and refers to misinformation being the norm. The acronym also means &quot;sexually oriented business&quot; (if pertaining to strip clubs) and more generally &quot;son of a bitch&quot; (a ruthless person).\n\nA Spanish dub of the film keeps the acronym S.O.B., claiming that it stands for &quot;Sois hOnrados Bandidos&quot; (You Are Honest Crooks). Notice that the second word begins with a mute H, not with an O. The Argentine title for the movie was changed to Se acabÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ el mundo (The World is Ended), having no relation to the original title.\n\nThree years later, when Edwards had his name removed from the writing credits of 1984's City Heat, he was billed under the pseudonym Sam O. Brown. (S.O.B.)\n\nWhen writing the screenplay Edwards drew upon several of his own experiences. The character of Felix Farmer is a person not unlike Edwards, while actress Sally Miles bears certain similarities to Julie Andrews (who plays her), Edwards' wife in real life.\n\nThe story of S.O.B. parallels the experiences of Edwards and Andrews in their infamous, but Academy Award-nominated failure, Darling Lili. Intended to reveal Andrews' heretofore unseen wicked and sexy side, that film had a troubled shoot, went significantly over budget, and was subjected to post-production studio interference.\n\nIn S.O.B., Andrews's character agrees (with some pharmaceutical persuasion) to &quot;show her boobies&quot; in a scene in the film-within-the-film. For this scene, comedian Johnny Carson thanked Andrews on his The Tonight Show for &quot;showing us that the hills were still alive,&quot;[cite this quote] alluding to a famous line from The Sound of Music opening sequence.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd2edafb0e63b1adcd571dda0eda738af98abf74","amp;dn":"S+O+B+%5B1981%5D+Blake+Edwards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd2edafb0e63b1adcd571dda0eda738af98abf74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,46,218,251,14,99,177,173,205,87,29,218,14,218,115,138,249,138,191,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
