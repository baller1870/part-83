With this release of LT+ you HAVE to have an original Benq or Liteon.\n\nLT+ for slim 9504 is next followed by LT+ for slim 0225\n\nThanks go to Team Jungle for their hard work and efforts in the development process.\nThanks go to Team Xecuter for their generous support and input to this project.\n\nYou can download the current batch of AP25 Patches from http://www.team-xecuter.com/forums/s...ad.php?t=58118 \n\n\n\n\ntools:\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:257b17fae220a0a2cfa69bac8a367d7028a736c8","amp;dn":"iXtreme+LT%2B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"257b17fae220a0a2cfa69bac8a367d7028a736c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,123,23,250,226,32,160,162,207,166,155,172,138,54,125,112,40,167,54,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
