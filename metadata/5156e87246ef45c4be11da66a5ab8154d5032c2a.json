According to Wainwright, the album &quot;focuses primarily on the theme of a relationship. In terms of the other records, I don't know how or why I would place it somewhere except that it's the newest.&quot;\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp \n\nplease seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5156e87246ef45c4be11da66a5ab8154d5032c2a","amp;dn":"Loudon+Wainwright+III...Little+Ship%281997%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5156e87246ef45c4be11da66a5ab8154d5032c2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,86,232,114,70,239,69,196,190,17,218,102,165,171,129,84,213,3,44,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
