Merging them increases your computer's performance considerably. On top of that, the &quot;Optimize&quot; defragmentation method consolidates free space on your hard disks so that new fragmentation can be kept to a minimum.\n\nIntelligent zone filing makes it possible to move your files into various physical sectors on a hard disk. As a result, frequently-used files can be saved on the fastest sectors of the hard disk and this improves your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s performance even further.\n\nO&amp;O Defrag Free edition not only merges scattered file fragments, it also repositions unused spaces on your hard disk so that they form one contiguous block. This will help reduce any new fragmentation.\n\nO&amp;O Defrag Free Edition gives you the option of two effectively proven methods:\n\n    * OPTIMIZE/Quick defragments existing files, but does not merge the free spaces on a hard disk.\n    * OPTIMIZE defragments your files, merges free space on a hard disk, and separates the database into zones.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b20294490db5124fed5bd6f060a0d762326516d","amp;dn":"O%26O+Defrag+Free+Edition+Jainy081","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b20294490db5124fed5bd6f060a0d762326516d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,32,41,68,144,219,81,36,254,213,189,111,6,10,13,118,35,38,81,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
