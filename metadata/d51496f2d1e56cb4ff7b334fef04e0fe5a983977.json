Here is day 03, of the Kyushu Basho\n\nFile Folder contains;\n-Kyushu.Day.03.E.mpg\tOriginal English broadcast *.mpg\n-Kyushu.Day.03.N.mpg\tOriginal Japanese broadcast *.mpg\n-Kyushu.Day.03.avi\tDual Language *.avi (use VLC media player for best results)\n-Kyushu.Day.03.docx\tthis description, in a document\n-Torrent downloaded from *emonoid.com.txt\t  -advertising!\n\nChoose the file(s) you wish to download, and please seed as long as you can.  The *.AVI file is the smallest (720x480) I dare make it to be able to play on a large screen LCD, as the original broadcast is NOT in HD.  Sorry to those who have asked in the past for me to make it smaller (faster DL).  \n\nTo those who haven't downloaded from me before, there ALWAYS seems to be a speed issue in the beginning.  I am on the ass-end of the internet and my provider also caps the speed to different nodes throughout the world.  That's the way it is... sorry!  I continue to seed throughout this Basho until the next one starts, and eventually (patience, younglings!) there are enough seeds (thank you to all who do!) to get the speeds up.  In other words: don't bother commenting on how slow the torrent's going, it's not going to get me to magically 'make it go'.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sumo.or.jp/eng/index.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Bum_Fluff&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/Bum_Fluff&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.*emonoid.com/users/bumfluff42&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.*emonoid.com/users/bumfluff42&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSumo, Kyushu, Basho, November 2010, Bum_Fluff\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d51496f2d1e56cb4ff7b334fef04e0fe5a983977","amp;dn":"SUMO+Kyushu+Basho-+Day+03+-+Nov+2010+%28Xvid-AVI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d51496f2d1e56cb4ff7b334fef04e0fe5a983977","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,20,150,242,209,229,108,180,255,123,51,79,239,4,224,254,90,152,57,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
