Don is  \n                    incredibly proud of his son David's affluent  \n                    lifestyle. The cars, the detached house and  \n                    private schooling for the children were things  \n                    Don could only dream about as a young man. His  \n                    wife Dora, on the other hand, has doubts about  \n                    her son's financial affairs.
