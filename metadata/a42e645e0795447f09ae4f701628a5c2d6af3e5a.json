Packing nothing but an open mind, Chris has agreed to \nenter Marys world via a road trip traversing Australia in order for her \nto attempt to convince him that the truth really is &quot;out there&quot; and \nthat aliens exist, or she must never discuss the subject with him \nagain.\n\nMary plans to leave no stone unturned in her efforts to convince \nChris. They will meet a host of colorful characters from alien \ncontactees to skeptical scientists. They will take part in a heated \ndebate with university professors, put key witnesses under pressure \nwith polygraph tests and scour the country for concrete evidence of \nextraterrestrial life.\n\nAlong the way they will argue until they are blue in the face about \nwho is right, and for Mary, this really is her last chance to prove to \nChris that she hasnt gone loopy and that there really are other \nbeings in the sky above. This is the search for the truth to save a \nrelationship.\n\n\n\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 100mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
