However, whilst this was understandable in the Madchester era of the late 1980s, is it acceptable now as they approach thirty? When does the party end?\nTo a soundtrack of North West England bands and musicians, including New Order, The Stone Roses and The Charlatans to name but a few, the show displayed a lazy world of drinking, drug consumption, and casual sex. However, the show was careful to show the consequences of such lifetsyle choices and searingly touched on suicide, unwanted pregnancies, apathy and disillusionment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcd6f0c747847b36daaf22cc648f05b84b2fda62","amp;dn":"Burn+It+-+Series+2++BBC+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcd6f0c747847b36daaf22cc648f05b84b2fda62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,214,240,199,71,132,123,54,218,175,34,204,100,143,5,184,75,47,218,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
