There were thousands of ordinary citizens on the streets at Toronto G20 Summit marching peacefully until the police closed in and shut them down. Many had gone downtown simply to see what was going on, only to find themselves forcibly dragged away by police and locked up for hours in a makeshift detention center without timely access to lawyers or medical treatment.\n\nIt's been eight months since the G20 and the iconic images are still with us ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ burning police cars, rampaging mobs, the massive security presence that according to the official story is all that stood between Canada's largest city and chaos. But thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not the whole story of TorontoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s G20. Astonishing new images caught on camera are now emerging and they expose a troubling new picture of what happened to hundreds of ordinary citizens caught in the huge police dragnet during those three highly-charged days last June.\n\nGillian Findlay presents a revealing new street-level perspective of what happened when thousands of police were deployed in downtown Toronto and instructed to do what was necessary to ensure the wall around the G20 Conference Centre was never breached. Exclusive eyewitness video obtained by [i]the fifth estate[/i] brings to light startling images captured on cellphones and minicams by the innocent bystanders who found themselves on the wrong side of all that G20 &quot;order.&quot; In a rare television interview, Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair explains why police took the actions they did.\n\nOn this edition of [i]the fifth estate[/i]: the summit from the street, and the people who never dreamed it could happen to them. The stories you'll hear will raise questions about what protest means in this country and what the limits to dissent have become.\n\nSource:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2010-2011/youshouldhavestayedathome/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2010-2011/youshouldhavestayedathome/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nYou can watch a streaming video of this program at the website above.\n\n-----\n\n[b]Technical Specs[/b]\n\n--- File Information ---\nFile Name:                    The Fifth Estate.25.Feb.2011.PDTV.XviD.theEmpire-philthy.avi\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):          45:04.262\nFile Size (in bytes):         366,004,224\n\n--- Container Information ---\nBase Type:                    AVI(.AVI)\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:             XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Duration:               45:04.262\nframe Width (pixels):         624\nframe Height (pixels):        352\nPixel Aspect Ratio:           1.000\nDisplay Aspect Ratio:         1.773\nframes Per Second:            29.970\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):         942\n\n--- Audio Information ---                                                      \nAudio Codec:                  0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate:            48000 Hz\nAudio BitRate Type:           VBR\nAudio Channels                2\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):          126\n\n\n*** Thanks to original uploader [b]philthy at TheEmpire.bz[/b] ***\n\n-----\n\n[b]About the fifth estate[/b]\n\nFor more than three decades, the fifth estate has been Canada's premier investigative documentary program, acquainting viewers with a dazzling parade of political leaders, shady characters and ordinary people whose lives were touched by triumph or tragedy. The tradition of provocative and courageous journalism which began with Adrienne Clarkson, Warner Troyer and Peter Reilly on September 16, 1975 continues unabated with our current team of Hana Gartner, Linden MacIntyre, Bob McKeown and Gillian Findlay.\n\n[b]A Ratings Success[/b]\nAfter airing more than 1,600 stories and more than 600 shows, the program has become a ritual for millions of Canadians from coast to coast. Many of its shows attracted spectacular numbers of viewers. More than two million tuned in to watch stories such as Eric Malling's Who killed JFK?, Hana Gartner's Life with Billy and Trish Wood's Karla Homolka.\n\nThese numbers reflect an appetite for the weekly dose of thought-provoking, insightful journalism practiced by the fifth, which often makes subheadlines and influences public policy. Its stories are routinely shown around the world as well. Television networks in 16 countries from Norway to Korea to Argentina showed Linden MacIntyre's provocative Emmy winning story about the 1991 Gulf Conflict called To Sell a War.\n\n[b]An Award Winning Program[/b]\nIn addition to its impact among viewers and on society, the fifth estate is also recognized by its peers. It has won a remarkable 243 awards, including an Oscar for best documentary, three international Emmy Awards, 28 Geminis, 20 awards and certificates for investigative reporting from the Canadian Association of Journalists and dozens of honours from The New York and Columbus International film and video festivals. the fifth estate won a prestigious Michener Award for meritorious public service journalism and the Justicia Award from the Canadian Bar Association for a series of reports on the police and justice system.\n\nWhat makes the fifth estate so successful? Long time host Linden MacIntyre probably says it best: &quot;We aren't interested in a lot of the distractions of the mass media. We're not into marketing and we're not into celebrity. We're interested in getting information, in exploring important issues and illuminating public policy, and about telling the stories in a strong narrative fashion.&quot;\n\nThe mission of the program could also be described this way; to be the home of incisive and original investigative journalism, to challenge assumptions and question conventional wisdom, and most importantly to give voice to victims of injustice who deserve to be heard but have been silenced.\n\nCBC's [i]The Fifth Estate[/i] website:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/fifth/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d20d07a1a803e7f0a30d1382895818fd44f2c8b5","amp;dn":"CBC+The+Fifth+Estate%3A+You+Should+Have+Stayed+at+Home+%282011%29+%28G20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d20d07a1a803e7f0a30d1382895818fd44f2c8b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,13,7,161,168,3,231,240,163,13,19,130,137,88,24,253,68,242,200,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
