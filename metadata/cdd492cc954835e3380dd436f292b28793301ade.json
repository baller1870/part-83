Her novels have been adapted numerous times for television, and commonly deal with such challenging themes as adoption, divorce, and mental illness. Addressing these issues has made her controversial because of her young readership.[1]\n\nWilson is perhaps best known for her series of novels featuring the character Tracy Beaker, who first appeared in Wilson's 1991 novel The Story of Tracy Beaker, from which has followed three sequels, as well as two CBBC television adaptations: The Story of Tracy Beaker and Tracy Beaker Returns.\n\n\nContains the following books:\n\n\nJacqueline Wilson - Buried Alive!\nJacqueline Wilson - Cliffhanger\nJacqueline Wilson - Dustbin Baby\nJacqueline Wilson - How to Survive Summer Camp\nJacqueline Wilson - Lola Rose\nJacqueline Wilson - Mark Spark in the Dark and Jimmy Jelly\nJacqueline Wilson - Midnight\nJacqueline Wilson - Secrets\nJacqueline Wilson - Starring Tracy Beaker\nJacqueline Wilson - The Dare Game\nJacqueline Wilson - The Illustrated Mum\nJacqueline Wilson - The Mum-Minder\nJacqueline Wilson - The Story Of Tracy Beaker\nJacqueline Wilson - The Suitcase Kid\nJacqueline Wilson - Video Rose\n\nUnabridged.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nVisit us for this and loads more:\n\nwww.audiobookvault.ws\n\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSeed and enjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd492cc954835e3380dd436f292b28793301ade","amp;dn":"Jacqueline+Wilson+Audiobook+Collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd492cc954835e3380dd436f292b28793301ade","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,212,146,204,149,72,53,227,56,13,212,54,242,146,178,135,147,48,26,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
