The borderline misogyny could get a bit juvenile in tunes like &quot;Stupid Girl.&quot; But on the other hand the group began incorporating the influences of psychedelia and Dylan into their material with classics like &quot;Paint It Black,&quot; an eerily insistent number one hit graced by some of the best use of sitar (played by Brian Jones) on a rock record. Other classics included the jazzy &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; where Jones added exotic accents with his vibes, and the delicate Elizabethan ballad &quot;Lady Jane,&quot; where dulcimer can be heard. Some of the material is fairly ho-hum, to be honest, as Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were still prone to inconsistent songwriting; &quot;Goin' Home,&quot; an 11-minute blues jam, was remarkable more for its barrier-crashing length than its content. Look out for an obscure gem, however, in the brooding, meditative &quot;I Am Waiting.&quot;\n\nTracklist:\n\n1. Mother's Little Helper - 2:43 \n2. Stupid Girl - 2:53 \n3. Lady Jane - 3:06 \n4.
