And when Lorraine Barry arrives at the first reading, the battle is begun between director and star, with the poor playwright caught in the middle. \n\nAdapted from a short story by NoeI Coward, Star Quality takes us behind the scenes of a new West End production. Conjuring up an authentic backstage world of talent and treachery, Coward creates a gallery of unforgettable characters; temperamental leading lady, ruthless director, jaded old troupers and, caught somewhere between them all, innocent young playwright. From tentative first rehearsal to triumphant opening night, the clash of egos becomes increasingly and hilariously bloody. But what emerges from the mayhem is a startling evocation of that most elusive gift of all - star quality.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96d3916478ee91e6bdad004e35f057ad95658e92","amp;dn":"Star+Quality+%28TV%29+%5B1985%5D+Susannah+York","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96d3916478ee91e6bdad004e35f057ad95658e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,211,145,100,120,238,145,230,189,173,0,78,53,240,87,173,149,101,142,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
