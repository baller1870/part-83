Experts of stealth and stalking, they can kill with a single shot from nearly a mile, or creep within yards of an enemy target remaining virtually invisible.\nThese are the shooters the army turns to when the chips are down. Starting with the first American sniper during the Revolutionary War and ending with the newest snipers and latest technology at the U.S. Army Sniper School, these soldiers have become true masters of their craft.\n\nFormat                           : AVI\nFile size                        : 627 MiB\nDuration                         : 44mn 56s\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 952 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : xvid\nDuration                         : 44mn 56s\nBit rate                         : 1 812 Kbps\nWidth                            : 480 pixels\nHeight                           : 368 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a2f55e688d3c863964d48333e579153dded558e","amp;dn":"Snipers+Stalk+and+Kill.XviD.WEBRIP.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a2f55e688d3c863964d48333e579153dded558e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,47,85,230,136,211,200,99,150,77,72,51,62,87,145,83,221,237,85,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
