It features Beck walking through various New York City locations, wearing cowboy attire and carrying a boombox. At some points, the action freezes and the camera zooms in on Beck in tableau. Later the camera zooms in on spies that have been following Beck the whole time.\n\nThe video has references to the films Midnight Cowboy and The 400 Blows.\n\nAt the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards Beck won a total of five &quot;moonmen&quot; awards. Two were for The New Pollution, and Devils Haircut won three: Best Editing, Best Direction, and Best Male Video.\n\nAs is common with his Odelay-era songs, Devils Haircut is driven by a number of samples: the drums in the choruses and drum breaks come from Pretty Purdie's Soul Drums; the drumbeat during the verses comes from Them's cover of James Brown's Out of Sight; and the guitar riff was taken from another Them cover (this time of I Can Only Give You Everything from Them Again,) but it was replayed by Beck, rather than sampled.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Haircut&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Haircut&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAbDcaADf&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/EAbDcaADf&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:12\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
