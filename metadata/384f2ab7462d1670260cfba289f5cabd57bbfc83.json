The remaining selections feature Smith with a variety of trios; guitarist Wes Montgomery is heard on &quot;Baby It's Cold Outside,&quot; one of two &quot;bonus&quot; cuts taken from other sessions that help to fill up this otherwise brief set. Smith is fine on &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; &quot;Santa Claus Is Coming to Town&quot; and two versions of &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; and, even if nothing all that unusual occurs, the performances can serve as high-quality background music during the Christmas season.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:384f2ab7462d1670260cfba289f5cabd57bbfc83","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Smith+-+Christmas+Cookin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"384f2ab7462d1670260cfba289f5cabd57bbfc83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,79,42,183,70,45,22,112,38,12,251,162,137,245,202,189,87,187,252,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
