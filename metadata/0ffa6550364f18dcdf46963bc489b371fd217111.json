Everyone else          \n           knew him as a divorced father working for an investment        \n           company. But they didn't know his other side-his dark          \n           side. Because Icarus was at his best when he was killing       \n           people. For years, he'd worked as a sleeper agent in           \n           America-but when the Soviet Empire collapsed, he found         \n           himself in a foreign country with no one to trust.             \n           Determined to break from his dark past, he started over        \n           with a new identity. But you can only escape your past         \n           for so long. When a sudden mishap in Hong Kong blows           \n           Icarus' identity, past and present collide - and the           \n           assassin realizes he is now the target. The people that        \n           want him dead will stop at nothing to get to him. And          \n           that means going after what he cares about most-his wife       \n           and daughter. Fighting for his life, Icarus is forced to       \n           face the demons of his past to protect the loved ones in       \n           his present. He must fight to save the only thing he's         \n           ever done right in his life. He needs to uncover who is        \n           after him and protect his family - before it's too late.       \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Dolph Lundgren............. : .......Edward Genn / Icarus      \n           Stefanie von Pfetten....... : Joey (as Stefanie Von Pfett      \n           Samantha Ferris............ : .......................Kerr      \n           David Lewis................ : .................Mr. Graham      \n           Lindsay Maxwell............ : ......................April      \n           John Tench................. : ......................Serge      \n           Bo Svenson................. : ......................Vadim      \n           Katelyn Mager.............. : .....................Taylor      \n           Monique Ganderton.......... : ........................Kim      \n           Slavi Slavov............... : .......................Oleg      \n           Stephen Chang.............. : John: Chinese Boss (as Step      \n           Igor Morozov............... : ............Russian Officer      \n           Mike Carpenter............. : ...............Young Icarus      \n           Marian Koprada............. : ................Young Vadim      \n           Chantal Forde.............. : ......................Janet      \n                                                                          \n                                                                      \n                      \n                             \n                       \n         \n                                                                        \n                                                                            \n                  Previous release had aspect ratio of 1.77.                \n                   Thanks to our friends at SADPANDA.
