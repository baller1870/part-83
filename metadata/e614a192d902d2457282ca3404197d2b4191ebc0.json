Building upon its patented predecessor and namesake, TruSurround XT not only solves the problem of playing 5.1 or 6.1 multichannel content over two speakers or headphones, but also utilizes proprietary algorithms from SRS Labs - Dialog Clarity and TruBass - to provide listeners with a truly immersive audio experience.\n\nTruSurround XT accepts input from up to a 7 channel (6.1) audio source and processing a 2 channel output. When receiving multichannel content, TruSurround XT virtualizes the channels, creating &quot;phantom&quot; speakers that appear to extend all\naround the listener, producing an amazing surround sound effect. When receiving mono or stereo content, TruSurround XT includes the functionality of SRS WOW to present an expansive three dimensional sound field.\n\n\nChangelog build 2429 (2011-01-05):\nUpdates:\n- Adds support for Intel new Core i5/i7 integrated graphics card with HDMI 1.4\n\nIssues resolved:\n- CyberLink PowerDVD 10 cannot play back MKV video files when ROXIO Creator 2011 Pro is installed\n- CyberLink PowerDVD 10 cannot pass through HD audio to external audio decoder on computers with an AMD Radeon HD 6800 graphics card installed\n\n\n\n======================================================================================================================\n\nNote about virus warnings: If you get a trojan or virus warning then it's a false positive! - I've added nothing!!\nYou get exactly the same warning when you download and install the retial version because it's the same setup.\nI only removed and modified some files to disable MoovieLive, Movie Remix and RichVideo and to make it pre-activated!\n\nHere's how to check the Digital Signatures:\n- Extract Setup.exe with 7-zip and open the directory where you extracted the files\n- Right click on an exe file, select properties and click on the Digital Signatures tab\n- Double click on the Signature and read the line below &quot;Digital Signature Information&quot;\n- If it says that the Digital Signature is OK, it means that the file isn't altered!\n-Click on the &quot;View Certificate&quot; button for more information\n\n======================================================================================================================\n\n\nInstall: Just run Setup.exe and you are done, it's registered and activated.\n\nNote: This Setup does not install the PowerDVD Toolbar (Mini Player Mode)\nIf you want to use it then extract the Tweak Pack and run Enable_Toolbar.bat\n\n\n============\n:: EXTRAS ::\n============\n\nBlack Skin for PowerDVD 10 Mark II\nChanges between the default and the modified skin:\n- Replaced the background and removed the Feature Icons (logos)\n- Changed the autohide delay from the tabs to 1 sec (default = 3)\n- Smaller Mini Mode: removed the Cyberlink logo &amp; the Config button\n- Fixed Mini Mode buttons (the white lines) + black Volume Control\n- Removed the Upgrade button and the divider before the Help button\n\n\nTweak Pack for PowerDVD 10\nBlu-Ray_Region_Reset.bat:         Resets the Blu-Ray region settings (remaining changes)\nDisable_BD_Mouse_Pop-up.bat:      Disables the Blu-Ray disk Mouse support Pop-up\nEnable/Disable_3DFeature.bat:     Enables/Disables the 3D Feature\nEnable/Disable_MoovieLive.bat:    Enables/Disables MoovieLive, Remix and Comment features\nEnable/Disable_CinemaMode.bat:    Enables/Disables the Cinema Mode\nEnable/Disable_CLFLVSplitter.bat: Enables/Disables the FLV Splitter *\nReset_HD_Dailog.bat:              Resets the High-Definition Content dialog **\nRemove/Restore_StartupApps.bat:   Removes/Restores the Startup Applications ***\nEnable/Disable_Toolbar.bat:       Enables/Disables the PowerDVD Toolbar (Mini Player Mode)\nEnable/Disable_Upgrade.bat:       Enables/Disables the Upgrade Popups and Buttons\n\n*    CLFLVSplitter.ax can cause a crash when you play flv videos in Windows Media Player\n    Disable_CLFLVSplitter.bat unregisters the FLV Splitter, which fixes the problem\n\n**   This comes in handy if you selected &quot;Don't ask me this question again&quot; and want to re-enable\n    or disable TrueTheater Lightning and Smart De-interlace when playing High-Definition content\n\n***  Removes the Startup Apps BDRegion and RemoteControl10 - Don't run this if you use a remote!\n\nCheers,\n\nADHDerby\n\n\n\nInstallation Info\nFor PowerDVD: UnRAR and Run SetUp.exe.\nFor Tweak Pack: Read Tweak Pack Readme.txt (follow it exactly).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e614a192d902d2457282ca3404197d2b4191ebc0","amp;dn":"PowerDVD+10+Mark+II+Ultra+Max+v10.0.2429.51+Preactivated+carter6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e614a192d902d2457282ca3404197d2b4191ebc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,20,161,146,217,2,210,69,114,130,202,52,4,25,125,43,65,145,235,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
