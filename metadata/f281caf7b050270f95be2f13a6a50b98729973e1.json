The subjects explored are wide-reaching and many of the themes contemporary, ranging from the problems in small rural backwaters (&quot;Rocky Brown&quot;), to songs which make reference to conflicts in the Middle East (&quot;Willow Weeps&quot;). The title track showcases Benji's effecting, driving guitar style, whilst &quot;Wallbreaker&quot; is a riddle song, about the overriding power of nature, regardless of human efforts to control it. The album features Ben Nichols (bass) and contributions from Sue Harris, John Kirkpatrick, Seth Lakeman and Stu Hanna, (who also produced the album). \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/benji-kirkpatrick/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/12/20/benji-kirkpatrick/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f281caf7b050270f95be2f13a6a50b98729973e1","amp;dn":"Benji+Kirkpatrick...Boomerang%282008%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f281caf7b050270f95be2f13a6a50b98729973e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,129,202,247,176,80,39,15,149,190,47,19,166,165,11,152,114,153,115,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
