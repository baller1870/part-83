We speak with Canadian physician and best-selling author, Dr. Gabor MatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. He argues that these responses are treating surface symptoms as causes while ignoring deeper roots. Dr. MatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© says children are in fact reacting to the broader collapse of the nurturing conditions needed for their healthy development.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb5370ec11af9e7c6d5fbf50bf41f76d2510cde2","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+24+nov+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb5370ec11af9e7c6d5fbf50bf41f76d2510cde2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,83,112,236,17,175,158,124,109,95,191,80,191,65,247,109,37,16,205,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
