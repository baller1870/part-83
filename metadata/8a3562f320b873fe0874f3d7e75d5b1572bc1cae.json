Whitney Duncan - My World Is Over (Xvid-2nafish)\n\n\nThis video has no logos or titles.\n\n\nKenneth Donald &quot;Kenny&quot; Rogers (born August 21, 1938) is an American country music singer-songwriter, photographer, record producer, actor, and entrepreneur. He has charted more than 120 hit singles across various music genres and topping the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone.\n\nTwo of his albums, The Gambler and Kenny, are featured in the About.com poll of &quot;The 200 Most Influential Country Albums Ever&quot;. He was voted the &quot;Favorite Singer of All-Time&quot; in a 1986 joint poll by readers of both USA Today and People. He has received hundreds of awards for both his music and charity work. These include AMAs, Grammys, ACMs and CMAs, as well as a lifetime achievement award for a career spanning six decades in 2003.\n\nLater success includes the 2006 album release, Water &amp; Bridges, an across the board hit, that peaked at #5 in the Billboard Country Albums sales charts, also charting high in the Billboard 200. The first single from the album, &quot;I Can't Unlove You,&quot; was also a chart hit. Remaining a popular entertainer around the world, the following year he completed a tour of the United Kingdom and the Ireland telling BBC Radio 2 DJ Steve Wright, his favorite hit was &quot;The Gambler&quot;. He has also acted in a variety of movies and television shows, most notably the title roles in Kenny Rogers as The Gambler and the MacShayne series as well as his appearance on the Muppet Show. Rogers currently resides in Nicholson, Georgia.\n\nIn the 21st century, Rogers was back at #1 for the first time in more than a decade with the 2000 single &quot;Buy Me a Rose&quot;, making him, at 61, the oldest artist in the history of country music to reach the chart summit. In doing so, he broke a 26-year-old record held by Hank Snow (who, in April 1974, was 59 years and 11 months old when he scored with &quot;Hello Love&quot;). Rogers held the record until 2003, when then 70-year-old Willie Nelson became the oldest artist to have a No. 1 on the country charts with his duet with Toby Keith, &quot;Beer For My Horses.&quot;\n\nRogers also released the critically acclaimed album Back to the Well.\n\nAlthough Rogers didn't record new albums for a couple of years, he continued to have success in many countries with more greatest hits packages. In 2004 42 Ultimate Hits, which was the first hits collection to span his days with the First Edition to the present, reached Number 6 on the American country charts and went gold. It also featured two new songs, &quot;My World Is Over&quot; with Whitney Duncan and &quot;We Are the Same&quot;. &quot;My World Is Over&quot; was released as a single and was a minor hit. In 2005 The Very Best of Kenny Rogers, a double album, sold well in Europe. It was the first new solo Kenny Rogers hits album to reach the United Kingdom for over a decade, despite many compilations there that were not true hits packages.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a3562f320b873fe0874f3d7e75d5b1572bc1cae","amp;dn":"Kenny+Rogers+feat.+Whitney+Duncan-My+World+Is+Over%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a3562f320b873fe0874f3d7e75d5b1572bc1cae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,53,98,243,32,184,115,254,8,116,243,215,231,93,91,21,114,188,28,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
