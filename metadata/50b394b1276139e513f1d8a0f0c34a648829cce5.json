Solomon is enslaved to work as a miner in the diamond fields under the command of warlord Captain Poison (David Harewood), while his son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is conscripted into the rebel forces and brainwashed into becoming a hardened killer. The RUF use the diamonds to fund their war effort, often trading them directly for weapons. One day, Solomon finds an enormous, pink diamond but is caught by Capt. Poison as he secretly buries it in the ground nearby. Moments later, government troops attack the mine and Capt. Poison is injured before he can get to the stone. Both he and Solomon are taken to prison in Freetown along with the rest of the rebels.Meanwhile, Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Rhodesian mercenary and gunrunner, is arrested attempting to smuggle diamonds into Liberia. Archer had been transporting the diamonds to Afrikaner mercenary, Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), his former commander in the 32 Battalion, the most decorated unit of the South African Border War made up of Angolan and Rhodesian soldiers and white South African officers. Coetzee is in turn employed by Tiara Diamond Company executive, Rudolph Van de Kaap (Marius Weyers) and his deputy, Rupert Simmons (Michael Sheen). Upon hearing of the pink diamond, Archer arranges for Solomon's release from prison; offering to help Solomon find his family if he leads Archer to the diamond. The RUF launches a massive assault on Freetown and crushes the government forces present, forcing Archer and Solomon to steal away from the city at night.\nRelease date: December 8, 2006\nFile size: 2.95GB\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450259/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0450259/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Adventure | Drama\n\nCast:\n\n# Leonardo DiCaprio as Danny Archer\n# Djimon Hounsou as Solomon Vandy\n# Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen\n# Kagiso Kuypers as Dia Vandy\n# Arnold Vosloo as Colonel Coetzee\n# Antony Coleman as Cordell Brown\n# Benu Mabhena as Jassie Vandy\n# Anointing Lukola as N'Yanda Vandy\n# David Harewood as Captain Poison\n# Basil Wallace as Benjamin Kapanay\n# Jimi Mistry as Nabil\n\n\n\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: mp4(.AVC)\nVideo Codec Type: X264\nAverage video bitrate: 2 500 Kbps\nMaximum video bitrate: 13.0 Mbps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nResolution: 1280x532\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.147\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: Blood Diamond (2006) 1080p AC3 (Dolby) 5 1ch Blu-ray ps3 Team.Thanks!\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 443 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels\n\nNOTE\nWe are searching for good encoders.Contact us if you wish to be in our gang!\nWe are always searching for new affliates,dedicated servers and early sources.You are most welcome if you can provide them.\nIf you like our encodes,keep them alive!\nGREETZ: DarkScene,Hawkseye,Noir,SceneUG,TheFalcon007,SUDesigner,HDScene Encoders,,TorrentState,Kingdom RG,MnM-RG,HDLiTE,UKB-KvCD,Movie-Torrentz,AhaShare,Torrent-Force RG,Fastline RG,1337x,Resource RG,ExtraTorrent RG,DDR all SceneUG releasers and Uploaders and all other p2p release groups out there!\n\nscreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img42.imageshack.us/img42/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img228.imageshack.us/img228/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img193.imageshack.us/img193/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img220.imageshack.us/img220/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img406.imageshack.us/img406/1011/blooddiamondhdsreleasem.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50b394b1276139e513f1d8a0f0c34a648829cce5","amp;dn":"Blood+Diamond+720p+BRrip+X264+AAC+vice+%28HDScene+Release%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50b394b1276139e513f1d8a0f0c34a648829cce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,179,148,177,39,97,57,229,19,241,216,160,240,195,74,100,136,41,204,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
