They were a regular live fixture on the London ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œpsychedelic revivalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ mini-scene of the early 1980s, and often toured with sparring partners The Milkshakes who included Billy Childish on guitar. The PrisonersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sound combined catchy, retro flavoured melodies, punky guitar riffs, a Steve Marriott-esque vocal style and a lead instrument of the then-unfashionable Hammond organ. The Prisoners never met with much commercial success during their original lifespan but have latterly been likened to Paul Weller and The Charlatans. Indeed Tim Burgess of the Charlatans has cited the Prisoners as a major influence.\n\nThe bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lineup was: Graham Day (vocals and guitar), Jamie/James Taylor (hammond organ), Allan Crockford (bass) and Johnny Symons (drums).\n\nAfter releasing several self-financed records and spending a year with Big Beat Records, in 1985 the Prisoners signed a new management deal with Acid Jazz that saw them move away from the London garageband tag and instead directly into the Mod revivial mainstream. They also made a patchy final album, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIn From The ColdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, for the ailing Stiff Records label. These deal were unsuccessful and the band split up acrimoniously in 1986. They have however reformed for live shows several times since then, and managed to release a final one-off single in 1997.\n\nSince splitting up the members of The Prisoners have featured in a wide range of bands.\n\n----\n\nNot always the best in quality, some songs are a scratchy in parts, but overall pretty good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95eee8664e5a0b13c1a4a63daee3e5bdd74d0822","amp;dn":"The+Prisoners+Discography+%284+studio+albums%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95eee8664e5a0b13c1a4a63daee3e5bdd74d0822","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,238,232,102,78,90,11,19,193,164,166,61,174,227,229,189,215,77,8,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
