Flat Foot\n\n\nBlues for Boston is lloyd ThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much anticipated third album, released in response to constant requests by his fans for an ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œall bluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ cd. And so these 13 songs are just that, all blues, played in ThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incredibly unique style, which combines elements of old time Delta masters with modern ideas and stories of today.\n\nThayer plays all of his songs lapstyle on squareneck resonator guitars, including a 1929 National tricone. Also included on this cd are several songs played on lap style 12 string guitar, with the strings raised by a piece of bone that Thayer cut himself. The 12 string adds a haunting, almost sitar like quality to songs like Fred McDowellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYou Got to MoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEverybody has to SufferÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Last, but not least, and always a crowd favorite at festivals and shows is the song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFlat FootÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ which is played on a home made one stringed diddley bow.\n\nThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s medley of Skip JamesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKilling FloorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and Bob DylanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMasters of WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ has already been receiving airplay on radio stations across the U.S., while his one chord free improvisational arrangement of the GrandMaster Flash song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MessageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\ndraws rave reviews wherever he plays.\n\nIn addition to eight powerful original songs, another standout track is lloydÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s version of the Son House classic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalking BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, which features ThayerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s improvisational skills, as he explores classical Indian melodies which share so much common ground with Delta style blues of old.\n\nLloyd has recently opened shows for Johnny Winter, John Hammond, Harry Manx, Paul Rishell and Annie Raines and many others. After his opening sets, audiences are usually left shaking their heads and asking ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWho ARE you?!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhere have you been HIDING?!?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow do you DO that??ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nEndless hours of playing on street corners and subway platforms have honed his songs and skills the old fashioned way, one song, one note, one heartbeat at a time. With the release of BLUES FOR BOSTON, lloyd Thayer is sure to emerge from the underground, one song, one note, one heartbeat, one friend, at a time............\n\n\nI only know it's good...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5df230b26f283ef5f8eaaeea3a9adf189db58373","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Lloyd+Thayer+-+Blues+For+Boston","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5df230b26f283ef5f8eaaeea3a9adf189db58373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,242,48,178,111,40,62,245,248,234,174,234,58,154,223,24,157,181,131,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
