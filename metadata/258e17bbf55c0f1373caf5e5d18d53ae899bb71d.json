Brownie's recordings as Blind Boy Fuller #2 are here, as well as the first recordings pairing him with longtime future partner Sonny Terry. His work with washboard player Oh Red and the mysterious Jordan Webb playing harmonica is every bit as effective, though, Tracks like &quot;Picking My Tomatoes&quot; and &quot;Born For Bad Luck&quot; get this set off to a wonderful start; the musical quotient stays high all, the way to the end.\n\n[color=orangered][b]Tracklist[/b] \n1.
