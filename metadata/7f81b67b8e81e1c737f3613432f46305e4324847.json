War has engulfed all of China, and the fallen empire has splintered into competing regions in the possession of rival warlords and generals, each vying for territorial control.\n\nAmong these figures is Cao Cao, a military genius and leader of the Wei armies, who has assumed effective rule over all of northern China. He travels south, across the Yangtze, to continue his campaign to reunify the country under his command.\n\nStanding in his path, however, are Liu Bei of the Shu, and Sun Quan of the Wu, who forge an alliance to turn back the Wei at the Battle of Chi Bi. Their partnership is short-lived, however, as the two soon turn against each other for possession of Jing province.\n\nThe war of the Three Kingdoms has reached a stalemate. Each general has tasked their couriers to travel the land, seeking promising young recruits to join the cause. Do you have what it takes to rise to the challenge and turn the tide of battle?\n\nSystem Requirements\nDynasty Warriors Online requires approximately 4.7 GB of free hard drive space to install.

The game has a short tutorial (visit http://dwo.wikia.com/wiki/Dynasty_Warriors_Online_Eng_Wiki for a quick way to finish the tutorial and other info)\n\nDWO has several gamemodes\n\n1: Quick Melee/Melee a 4vs4 battle with 5 gametypes \na: Capture (also known as Suppress)\nThe most common Melee Type. In these battles, your objective is to capture bases\nb: Defeat (also known as K.O.)\nIn these battles, each team simply have to defeat the specified number of units total: either 2000 or 3000\nc: Confront\nThe strict PvP mode. In these battles, your objective is to defeat 10 enemy officers before your opponent team. \nd: Search\nIn this mode the purpose is to bring treasure to allied bases as many and as fast as possible\ne:Defeat the Leader\nThe only way to get this mode in melee is by random chance when you play with unknown victory condition, you cannot select it explicitly.Defeat the Leader of the opposing faction\nf: Unknown\nUnknown (including defeat commander) a.k.a. Unknown 2\nIf you choose this type of a battle, the winning condition will be randomly chosen from one of the 5 above. Additionally, no matters what the victory conditions is, the generals have a high chance of appearing as if it were defeat leader mode.\n\nUnknown (excluding defeat commander) a.k.a. Unknown 1\n\nThis mode is the same as above but Confront and Defeat the Leader are excluded from the random poll. Also the generals will not spawn at the start of the battle.\n\nThe victory condition is actually determined at the moment you create the battle, however the game will not tell you that, but it's possible to determine it indirectly\n\n2: Quests:\n\t \nIn Dynasty Warriors Online, quests serve several purposes. They can improve your Domestic Skills, give you gold or items, and increase your Honor. Your actions during a quest are evaluated, and at the completion of the quest, you get a rank ranging from S to E. Generally, the better you do on a quest, the better the reward.\nthere are quests for single player, 2 players and 3 players\n\n3: Arena\nAn arena is a 4v4 confront melee battle that takes place in a small area with only neutral(yellow) troops. It is different from the confront melee in that you always start with all your temper upgrades and will always receive at least two items at the end of the battle (no gear or weapons though)\n\n4: Campaign\nCampaigns are faction vs faction wars that decide who takes over the city. If you have played the empire series in Dynasty Warriors console games, the concept is similar to that. these are 4v4. Campaigns are not always available, they are announched trough the Aeria forums and take several hours if joining the full span\n\n5: Showdown\nShowdowns are 12v12 battles that take place on weekends when there is no campaign scheduled. Showdowns are usually available for 3 hours and take place in 15 minute intervals, they are commonly announched trough the Aeria forums\n\nCurrently, it is adviced when creating a character to join either Wei or Wu due to overpopulation of Shu (Due to Shu being the more popular console game faction, not due to either faction being better or having better items)\n\nfor a repeat of the installation instructions go to http://www.aeriagames.com/node/53414\n\nHave fun, drop me a line on Aeria games (a1whizzy) if you there\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f81b67b8e81e1c737f3613432f46305e4324847","amp;dn":"Dynasty+Warriors+Online","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f81b67b8e81e1c737f3613432f46305e4324847","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,129,182,123,142,129,225,199,55,243,97,52,50,244,99,5,228,50,72,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
