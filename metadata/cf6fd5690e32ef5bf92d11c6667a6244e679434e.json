A two-part dramatisation of D H Lawrence's classic novel, Lia Williams, Robert Glenister and Roger Allam.. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Chatterley's_Lover&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Chatterley's_Lover&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLady Chatterley's Lover is a novel by D. H. Lawrence, first published in 1928. The first edition was printed in Florence, Italy; it could not be published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960. (A private edition was issued by Inky Stephensen's Mandrake Press in 1929).[1] The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical relationship between a working-class man and an aristocratic woman, its explicit descriptions of sex, and its use of (at the time) unprintable words.\n\nThe story is said to have originated from events in Lawrence's own unhappy domestic life, and he took inspiration for the settings of the book from Eastwood in Nottinghamshire where he grew up. According to some critics, the fling of Lady Ottoline Morrell with &quot;Tiger&quot;, a young stonemason who came to carve plinths for her garden statues, also influenced the story.[2] Lawrence at one time considered calling the novel Tenderness and made significant alterations to the text and story in the process of its composition. It has been published in three different versions.\n\n\n\nCast:\nLia Williams\nRobert Glenister\nRoger Allam.. \n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration : 114mn 1s \nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\n\n\n\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf6fd5690e32ef5bf92d11c6667a6244e679434e","amp;dn":"Lady+Chatterley%5C%27s+Lover+-+Audio+Drama+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf6fd5690e32ef5bf92d11c6667a6244e679434e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,111,213,105,14,50,239,91,249,45,17,198,102,122,98,68,230,121,67,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
