Vito Scaletta, Mafia II\\'s conflicted leading man, does not lead an easy life. War, murder, and betrayal are common themes in his complex existence--the prices paid for booze, money, status, and sex. Like most aspiring made men, Vito knows the risks of his lifestyle, but the lure of earthly pleasures is too great to ignore. Mafia II, the game he stars in, is also an earthly pleasure, as well as a cerebral delight that any fan of great storytelling will revel in. The twisting narrative is almost certain to draw you in, and superb dialogue spoken by a talented voice cast brings the characters they portray to life. It\\'s easy to get engrossed in this world of tenuous allegiances and pompous personalities, though there are a few oddities scattered about that may occasionally yank you back to reality. Most notably, Mafia II\\'s detailed open city is curiously underutilized, giving you few reasons to explore it and providing precious little to do outside of the main story. Yet while Mafia II is not the fully featured open-world game it seems to be at a glance, the tremendous story, the fantastic action, and the lovely city overflowing with striking visual touches make for an exciting mob drama.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy this great new game from ThrDude!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a925ea9c9f8e5247bbe080e4405dab77259313df","amp;dn":"Mafia+II+-+ThrDude","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a925ea9c9f8e5247bbe080e4405dab77259313df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,37,234,156,159,142,82,71,187,224,128,228,64,93,171,119,37,147,19,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
