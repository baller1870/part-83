Later, the drivers are asked to do carry out the simplest of tasks in our Ride the Rails challenge by attempting to drive in a straight line...driving forwards and then backwards along some rails lined up over a shallow water drop. Finally, our horrendous eight test their ability to see what's behind them when they take on our Blind Spot Challenge. Sounds simple enough, but once again the task seems beyond far too many of our drivers.\n\nOne driver graduates after showing significant improvement and our experts continue to watch closely to determine who will be Canada's Worst Driver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c34a3d55a513fcb5d1d120d8d62619a643c7c01","amp;dn":"Canada%5C%27s+Worst+Driver+S06E02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c34a3d55a513fcb5d1d120d8d62619a643c7c01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,52,163,213,90,81,63,203,93,29,18,13,141,98,97,154,100,60,124,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
