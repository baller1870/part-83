Written by Gregg Allman, the five-minute studio version first appeared on their 1969 debut album The Allman Brothers Band. But the song's full power only manifested itself in concert, when it was the basis for much longer and more intense performances. This was captured in a classic take on the Allman Brothers' equally classic 1971 double live album At Fillmore East, where a 23-minute epic rendition takes up the entire final side. It was this recording that garnered &quot;Whipping Post&quot; spots on both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll list and Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.\n\nAfter the Allmans broke up and re-formed in 1989, &quot;Whipping Post&quot; was carried forward by various personnel configurations. A 2003 Beacon Theatre performance showed up the following year on the live album One Way Out, and features the Warren Haynes/Derek Trucks era of the band.\n\nGregg Allman himself performs &quot;Whipping Post&quot; with his outside-the-Allmans Gregg Allman and Friends group's concerts, but in a style that he describes as &quot;its funky, real rhythm nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ blues-like&quot; and in which he plays guitar rather than organ.[ Allman re-recorded the song for his 1997 album Searching for Simplicity, giving the song a jazzier groove, but rendering it in straight 4/4 time instead of the complex triple time of the original composition.\n\nGregg Allman was 21 years old when the song was first recorded. Its writing dates back to late March 1969, when The Allman Brothers Band was first formed. Gregg had failed to make a name for himself as a musician during a late-1960s stint in Los Angeles, and was on the verge of quitting music altogether when his brother Duane Allman called and said his new band needed a vocalist. Gregg showed the band 22 songs he had written, but only &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;It's Not My Cross to Bear&quot; were deemed usable. Gregg, the group's only songwriter at the time, was commissioned to create additional songs that would fit into the context of the new band, and in the next five days he wrote several, including &quot;Whipping Post&quot;.\n\nGregg's travails in the music business would provide the thematic inspiration for the new song, which was written quickly on an ironing board cover: He later said: &quot;It came so fast. I didn't even have a chance to get the paper out. That's the way the good songs comeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½they just hit you like a ton of bricks.&quot;\n\nThe blues rock song's lyrics center on a metaphorical whipping post, an evil woman and futile existential sorrow. Writer Jean-Charles Costa described the studio version's musical structure as a &quot;solid framework of [a] song that lends itself to thousands of possibilities in terms of solo expansion. ... [It is] in modified 3/4 time, building to a series of shrieking lead guitar statements, and reaching full strength in the chorus supported by super dual-lead guitar.&quot; The result was called by Rolling Stone an &quot;enduring anthem ... rife with tormented blues-ballad imagery&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a6e41eb8b6af34944543089302af5f934a28c90","amp;dn":"The+Allman+Brothers+Band+-+Whippin%5C%27+Post+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a6e41eb8b6af34944543089302af5f934a28c90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,110,65,235,139,106,243,73,68,84,48,137,48,42,245,249,52,162,140,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
