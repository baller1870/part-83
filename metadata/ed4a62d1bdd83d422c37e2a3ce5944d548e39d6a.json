More than content with a life of one-night-stands, Henry decides to give up his noncommittal lifestyle when he meets and falls for Lucy (Barrymore). However, when he discovers that Lucy has no short term memory, Henry finds himself having to win her heart again with every new day. Sean Astin and Rob Schneider also star. \n\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed4a62d1bdd83d422c37e2a3ce5944d548e39d6a","amp;dn":"50+First+Dates%282004%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed4a62d1bdd83d422c37e2a3ce5944d548e39d6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,74,98,209,189,216,61,66,44,55,226,163,206,89,68,213,72,227,157,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
