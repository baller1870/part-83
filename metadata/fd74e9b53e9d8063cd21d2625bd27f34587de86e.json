Ping, which is linked to your iTunes account, allows you to create a personal profile and share your purchases and reviews with friends, and artists you like. It looks very much like a basic Facebook News Feed or Twitter, but just about music. At the moment Ping feels underdeveloped. You can't share your listening habits, like Last.fm, and manual sharing is limited to the iTunes Store, not your own library. There's no option to share what you're listening to right now, which is pretty terrible!

Far from being just a chat program, the all-new Microsoft instant messaging client is now a complete communications center with support for social networks.\n\nAs with previous versions, Windows Live Messenger 2011 is part of the Windows Live Essentials suite, which also includes other apps such as Mail, Writer, Sync, Companion, Family Safety, Photo Gallery and Movie Maker, as well as the Bing Bar. Luckily the installation process lets you choose exactly which apps you want on your system.\n\nWindows Live Messenger features a revamped interface. Right after launching it, and thanks to new integration with other services such as Facebook, MySpace and YouTube, the so-called Social Highlights lets you check your friendsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ latest news and status messages at a glance. If you still prefer the old style, worry not: Windows Live Messenger lets you switch to the traditional contact list by using the Contacts mode. Bear in mind though that if you use a different email account for your social networks, youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to connect the services on the Windows Live website.\n\nBesides the social element, everything else is pretty much the same on Windows Live Messenger 2011, only with a slightly fresher appearance. You can still do video and voice calls, play online games with your friends, share files, and of course customize the programÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appearance with skins and color themes. Emoticons have been revamped, and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ finally! ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ you can have multiple conversations tabbed in one single window.\n\nThe main drawback to the all-new Windows Live Messenger 2011 is that it only works on Windows Vista and Windows 7. So if you still use Windows XP youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll have to stick to the old version ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ or upgrade your system!\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark CD Art Display 2.0.1 [/b]\n\n \n\nCD Art Display (formerly Winamp CD Case) is a free desktop program that shows the current song cover in a skinnable display.

You probably have a favorite video player by now, but that doesn't mean you can't test new apps and change your mind.\nGOM Player is one of those players that goes unnoticed but proves to be an excellent tool when you take the time to give it a try. This compact, easy-to-use video player lets you enjoy video files and movies in a wide variety of formats. What's more, you won't have problems with codecs because GOM Player already includes them ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and if not, it automatically searches for the appropriate codec online.\n\nGOM Player shows off a sleek interface with support for skins and has other powerful features: support for subtitles, favorites manager, support for playlists, use mouse and keyboard shortcuts for many functions and more. What GOM Player misses, for example, is the ability to take screenshots or even more important, to resume playback right where you left it (something I personally use a lot).\n\nGOM Player offers to install the Google Toolbar during its installation process but you may as well decline the offer. As for the rest, it's a great video player that's well worth a tryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ even if you already have a favorite player.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]WinXP/2003/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark GOM Media Player 2.1.27.5031[/b] \n\n \n\nGOM Player is a popular video app that plays pretty much any video format you want.

With so many media formats out there, VLC Media Player is a catch-all player that can handle anything.\n\nIf you're looking for a great alternative to Windows Media Player, iTunes, RealPlayer and others, VLC Media Player is the application you need.\n\nNow in its 1.0 release, VLC Media Player is simply the most stable, flexible and lightweight audio and video players around today. While other media players will play unusual formats after downloading a codec, or simply refuse to play things, VLC Media Player covers tons of formats, from MPEG to FLV and RMBV files. In addition to this, you can also use it to preview files you are downloading, because it will play parts of files. It takes no time to start up either, so opening it up to preview something is no trouble at all.\n\nVLC Media Player has great hotkey support, if you take the time to learn the shortcuts so it can be controlled without touching your mouse. If you're watching DVDs or video files through it, this is not an issue. For music, it plays more or less any file and features an equalizer and playlist creation. VLC Media Player isn't as intuitive as iTunes as a media manager, but it's a much more flexible player in terms of file formats. You can even use VLC to convert your files, and on top of all the formats and physical media it will play, many streaming protocols and TV capture cards are supported.\n\nVLC Media Player makes it easy to add subtitles to your video files too - just add the SRT file to the folder where your video is kept, and it will automatically play with subtitles. The interface is functional, but by no means attractive - but you can download skins to completely change VLC Media Player's appearance. The preferences menu is comprehensive without being overwhelming, and there is extensive documentation online.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark Winamp Pro Plus! 5.581[/b]\n\n \n\nWinamp was born as a very basic media player and has slowly but consistently improving for many years. Its main purpose was to be completely customizable and through the years, many people have contributed to a library that now consists of over 20,000 skins and loads of plug-ins.\nWhen Winamp version 5 was released, Nullsoft redeemed themselves in the public's eyes after producing a much improved player to replace Winamp 3. They didn't need much encouragement as they justified skipping version number 4 by saying that it was such a huge improvement that it deserved to be called 5!\n\nLuckily they are justified in their opinion, as Winamp offers everything you might want in a media player. Using the skins, you can set it to look like the original or the current default which looks great and puts you in control of all your media quickly and easily. I particularly like the minimized player that consists of a small bar that you can place on the edge of your screen. Of course, if neither of these agree with your taste you can download and try any of the thousands others available on the Winamp website.\n\nWinamp supports a wide range of file formats, and because the program is small and simple, it works quickly on almost all computers. Have a look through the available plug-ins and you will also find that you can hook up your iPod and manage its music library. \n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]WinXP/2003/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark Xion 1.0.126[/b]\n\n \n\nXion is a high fidelity, deliciously sweet, out of this world audio player. Xion features a new standard in skin support. Baffled by script syntax? Pulling your hair out over slicing up skin elements? Crying over spilt milk? Xion has arrived and it brings style, candy and sanity back to your desktop.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]WinXP/2003/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark Yahoo! Messenger 10[/b]\n\n \n\nYahoo! Messenger is an instant messaging client with loads of customizable features, support for sound and video chats, file sharing capabilities and integration with third-party tools.\nWith Yahoo! Messenger 10 you'll be able to keep in touch with your online friends, not only within the Yahoo! network, but also with your contacts from MSN, Gmail, Facebook and other networks, which Yahoo! Messenger imports via an easy step-by-step wizard.\n\nRegarding design and layout, this new version of Yahoo! Messenger features a shiny, user-friendly interface that makes it a breeze to use. It also includes a complete settings menu and, like any other decent IM client these days, a ton of customizable settings: avatars, interface skins, animated wallpapers (a bit too ad-ridden for my taste) and the usual collection of emoticons, winks and other goodies to spice up your chats.\n\nYahoo! Messenger 10 includes many little details that you'll probably discover only after using it for some time: things like invisibility preferences (you can choose to be hidden from a certain contact only), integration with Twitter and other social networks, an excellent chat archive utility, the handy Photo Sharing tool and the wide variety of games and activities you can play with your friends make of this program an excellent choice for IM communication.\n\nBut if there's one feature that stands out in Yahoo! Messenger 10 it's video calls. Image quality is simply amazing, one of the fastest and smoothest I've seen. With all these excellent characteristics, I wouldn't be surprised if Yahoo! Messenger 10 became your new favorite IM client!\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]WinXP/2003/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xWinrar 3.93 [/b]\n\n \n\nWinRAR is a must-have in any modern-day PC toolkit. This application not only includes support for extracting virtually any kind of file compression format, it also boasts a no-nonsense approach to reducing file sizes.\n\nSome will argue that WinRAR isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t as quick as rival WinZip at compressing files. However, for the small time difference, WinRAR leaves you with a significantly smaller archived file at the end of the process. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more, the application allows you to save files into both .ZIP and .RAR formats, with bunches of options for speeding up compression times and reducing file sizes.\n\nAlthough many newcomers might be put off by the sheer range of features and settings within WinRAR, the interface doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take long to get accustomed to, and if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re still really stuck thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a simple wizard-based system that walks you through the process of extracting or compressing. All this adds up to make WinRAR a dependable utility that performs better than any other tool in its class.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]WinXP/2003/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]Snow Panther Winrar 3.93[/b]\n\n \n\nWinRAR is a must-have in any modern-day PC toolkit.

Comparing texts is therefore very easy, and every line is numbered. Font size in Notepad++ can be increased simply by holding CTRL and the mouse wheel used to zoom in. Pressing F12 makes the current tab float above everything else in Windows.\n\nFor coding, Notepad++ recognizes many programming languages, and will automatically make something like HTML much easier to view by color coding the text. It also has an excellent find and replace tool. As a replacement for Window's Notepad, NotePad++ is incredible, because it has so many more features and abilities, while still being incredibly lightweight and stable.\n\nNotePad++ is a functional application, but it won't win any prizes for looks, and many of the functions are only useful to programmers. However, anyone who writes text will find Notepad++ a useful tool, and much better than Windows Notepad.\n\nNotepad++ 5.8.3 Replacer is fully uninstallable, you can decide whether you want to uninstall just the replacement tweak or the whole Notepad++ application.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]WinXP/2003/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark Rainmeter 1.3 [/b]\n\n \n\nRainmeter used to be a very techy application customizable performance meter, but with this version 1.0 release, it's become much more user friendly, and can do some really cool things to your windows desktop.\n\nRainmeter now come pre-installed with a theme called &quot;Enigma&quot;, which is a great example of how cool your desktop can look. You can add clocks, calendars, RSS, mail Twitter readers, plus a whole range of system monitors and a lot more. Everything is customisable, and there are tons of other themes you can download for free to give your desktop a really personal feel.\n\nEnigma has been included for a reason - it's really slick, and makes your desktop a really functional space. As a way of freshening your desktop, Rainmaker's excellent! While it's much more user friendly than before, beginners can still easily get lost in the configuration options and settings, although there's little reason to mess around with them unless you want to create your own look. Creation is now much easier and doesn't require coding, although you can still go there if you want!\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark v3 Foobar 1.1.1 [/b]\n\n \n\nAudio players usually feature a sophisticated interface full of buttons, lights and other types of eye-candy. But there's always an exception to the rule; in this case, it's foobar2000.\n\nfoobar2000 is exactly the opposite of what you would expect in an audio player. It features the simplest, most minimalistic interface you'll ever see in this kind of program. But don't get me wrong, because this doesn't mean you don't get any interesting functionality.\n\nTo begin with, foobar2000 is extraordinarily fast ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it hardly took half a minute to index my huge music library ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and extremely light on resources. You simply won't notice it's running. Also, as it can be controlled with customizable keyboard hotkeys (or media keys, if your keyboard has them) you don't really to open the program's window.\n\nLike I said, foobar2000 hides a bunch of interesting features under its simple appearance. It plays a dozen formats (the list of which can be easily expanded with additional components), features gapless playback, supports full Unicode, includes advanced tagging functionality and even lets you rip audio CDs and convert files from one format to another, provided you install the necessary plug-ins.\n\nIn all, foobar2000 would never win a design contest, but it's undoubtedly one of the lightest, fastest and most functional audio players you'll find.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]Xp/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark Revo Uninstaller Pro 2.4.3[/b]\n\n \n\nOne thing that I've always thought is woefully inadequate in Windows is the Add/Remove Program console in the Control Panel.\nUntil now, I'd been using CCleaner to remove programs simply because I find it much easier to navigate what's on my system than using Windows default tool. However, Revo Uninstaller has changed all that. Revo Uninstaller is definitely the best uninstaller I've ever used on Windows and allows you to remove even the most stubborn programs.\n\nUsing Revo Uninstaller is very simple. As soon as its installed, the main interface displays which programs are installed. Simply select the one you want to remove and Revo proceeds to perform a very through removal process including making a backup point in case anything goes wrong or it removes something you don't want it to.\n\nRevo delves deep into your Registry to remove all entries and other temporary files that most other uninstallers leave behind. At each step, Revo Uniinstaller prompts you to select which files you want to remove. This was the only thing I found a little unintuitive first time round because I selected everything and then clicked &quot;Next&quot; but what you're supposed to do is select everything, click &quot;Delete&quot; to remove them, and then &quot;Next&quot;. Once you've done it once though, it's very clear how the procedure works.\n\nThere is a Pro version of Revo Uninstaller although the free version is so powerful that I can't see any real need to upgrade to it unless you've simply been unable to remove a program with the free version.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]Xp/Vista/7[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]xDark ObjectDock 2.0 [/b]\n\n \n\nbjectDockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ is a program that enables users to organize their shortcuts, programs and running tasks into an attractive and fun animated Dock. By allowing users to have more control over how they organize their desktop, users can take control of their desktop icons and shortcuts to have them be available when where and how they need them. This, all with the unique style and top-rate performance that ObjectDock is known to deliver!\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]xDark[/i]\n________________________________________________________\n\n[b]TrueCrypt 7.0a SP[/b]\n\n \n\nIf you're on the move regularly or your hard drive is accessible by third parties, it's always vulnerable to attack or your privacy can be compromised by prying eyes. One way to prevent such compromises is by encrypting data.\nTrueCrypt aims to do this by allowing you to encrypt data &quot;on-the-fly&quot;. This means that data is automatically encrypted or decrypted immediately before it is loaded or saved without any further action on your part. Nothing can be encrypted or decrypted without using the correct password or encryption keys.\n\nThis encryption extends to entire file systems such as file names, folder names, file contents, free disk space etc. The good thing about TrueCrypt is that it doesn't get in the way of you dragging and dropping files. Some encryption programs that work on-the-fly prevent you from doing so easily or add a delay to the transfer but that's not the case with TrueCrypt. The other good thing is that TrueCrypt never saves any decrypted data to a disk ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ it only stores them temporarily in your RAM which is far more secure because when you restart or turn off your computer, the volume will be dismounted and files stored in it will be inaccessible and still encrypted.\n\nTrueCrypt takes you through the encryption process step-by-step via a handy wizard. Just select the volume that you'd like to encrypt and then click &quot;Create Volume&quot; to encrypt it. This will create a TrueCrypt &quot;container&quot; which acts like normal file or folder but of course, it's totally encrypted. Note that if you select an existing file, TrueCrypt will not encrypt it - rather it will delete and replace it with a container.\n\n[b]OS requirements:[/b] [i]Xp/Vista/7[/i]\n\n[b]n0ak95 Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©2010 Radikal Modds Company Europe /","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd74e9b53e9d8063cd21d2625bd27f34587de86e","amp;dn":"Customized+Applications+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd74e9b53e9d8063cd21d2625bd27f34587de86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,116,233,181,62,157,128,99,205,33,210,98,91,210,127,52,88,125,232,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
