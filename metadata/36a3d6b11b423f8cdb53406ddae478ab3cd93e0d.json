(29GB). I had to brave the cold winter here and head o a neighbourhood\ninternet cafe with my laptop to assure everyone we didn't mean to let you down.\n\nAnyway, we got back up and running earlier than expected from what our ISP\nhad indicated. They have been truly great to work with since our switchover to\nfibe-service levels of speed. We some times do still experience minor brown-outs\nhowever bear with us as we have incredible speed when justified for a particular\nset of torrents and we plan to upgrade even more soon if our budget allows (they\nare changing rate plans we understand).\n\nBy the way, the torrent edit feature hasn't worked for a while. Could someone \nkindly fix this for me. With thanks!\n\nAlso it would be handy if we had a profile section where someone could click\nto send an email to find out if you are down (or whatever) and where you\ncould post a comment to keep your peers assured of such matters and circumstances\nif ever needed. God forbid.\n\nThis movie we bring you today is a real treat. An Austrian couple may just have\nhad their baby taken by a Turkish couple deported back to their own country -\nas a result of a mistake made by a nun along the way, it would appear!\n\nFor those that follow developments at the EU, this is an interesting look\nat the Turkish cultural implications for German Austrians for example\nand the reverse is true of course. I'm not saying that is not the case here.\n\nI fell in love with the Austrian gal from the start of th movie (she also has\ngreat unmistakably German-French warmth too). Anyway, I couldn't fathom placing\nher at risk in border smuggling - however its only a movie after all!\n\nEnjoy this important movie for Europeans interested in cross-cultural implications\nfor present day Europe\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\nEnglish SRT (UTF-8) subtitles - tested on our player and worked fine.\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36a3d6b11b423f8cdb53406ddae478ab3cd93e0d","amp;dn":"Born+in+Absurbistan+%28German+with+subtitles%29+moviesbyrizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36a3d6b11b423f8cdb53406ddae478ab3cd93e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,163,214,177,27,66,63,140,219,83,64,109,218,228,120,171,60,217,62,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
