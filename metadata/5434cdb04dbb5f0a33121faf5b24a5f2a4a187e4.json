And use less electricity too! How? All computers suffer from fragmentation ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where files are broken up and scattered all across your disk drives. This makes it take longer to read, write and save files. Plus since your PC is working harder than it needs to, more wear and tear occurs. Diskeeper with new IntelliWriteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ fragmentation prevention resolves this by preventing up to 85% of all fragmentation from happening in the first place. Any remaining fragmentation is quickly eliminated in real time thanks to DiskeeperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s InvisiTaskingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology.

Left alone, it will bring your computer to a halt. Fragmentation is continual and with the number of todayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s applications, peripherals, and file sizes, it accumulates hourly. No manual defragmenter will prevent this. Diskeeper 2010 is the only defragmenter ever built that defragments in real time without requiring a schedule. Your computer will run faster with Diskeeper 2010 installed - period.\n\nAvailable in Diskeeper 2010, InvisiTasking provides up-to-the-moment defragmentation without tapping into active system resources. The result: completely invisible yet robust automatic defragmentation that acts in real time to keep your computer running at maximum performance.\n\nInvisiTaskingÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® technology offers true transparent, background processing technology allows Diskeeper 2010 to defragment your computer in real-time, completely eliminating the need for cumbersome maintenance operations.

Diskeeper 2010 Professional enhances the reliability and performance of your computerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½automatically! \n\nDiskeeper 2010 I-FAASTÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â® file optimization technology accelerates file access times to meet the heavy workloads of file-intensive applications. Utilizing a specially formulated technology, I-FAAST closely monitors file usage and organizes the most commonly accessed files for the fastest possible access, boosting file access and creation to speeds above and beyond the capabilities of your system when it was new, up to 80% faster.  \n\nHigh-power computer systems require high power-defragmentation engines. Only Diskeeper 2010 includes the advanced technology necessary to eliminate large volume fragmentation found on big and busy computers. The remarkable Terabyte Volume EngineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ (TVE) technology. TVE is the only defrag technology with the necessary horsepower to eliminate the rapid fragmentation build-up that occurs in high-traffic volumes that handles millions of files.\nTVE was initially developed for the highest capacity servers but has now also become essential for the high end power user. Large databases, CAD programs -- Diskeeper 2010 handles the biggest jobs fast and thoroughly. The greater the number of files and fragments on a volume, the more dramatic TVE's benefits will be. Nothing compares to TVE's ability to eliminate enterprise level fragmentation. In a class of its own, TVE makes real-time power computer defragmentation a fact.\n\nDiskeeper 2010 Professional FEATURES:\n* New! IntelliWriteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ fragmentation prevention technology. IntelliWrite prevents up to 85% of the fragmentation every system suffers from. It intelligently writes contiguous files to the disk so system resources are not wasted creating fragmentation.
