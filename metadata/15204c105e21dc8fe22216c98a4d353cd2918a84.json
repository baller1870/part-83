To contain the growing criminal population, a vast network of for-profit, \nprivate prisons springs up, creating a lawless subculture ruled by gangs, cold-blooded killers and sociopaths. The worst of these \nprisons is Terminal Island. Convicted cop-killer Carl Lucas arrives on the Island to serve his life sentence just as ruthlessly ambitious \ntelevision personality September Jones launches the ultimate reality show, Death Race. A brutal prison yard demolition derby that pits \nprisoners against each other in steel reinforced, heavily armed vehicles, Death Race offers the winner the ultimate prize: \nfreedom ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ if he can survive to enjoy it. When Lucas signs up to be a driver, the stage is set for the birth of a legendary racer.\n\nCast: \nDanny Trejo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Goldberg\nSean Bean ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Markus Kane\nVing Rhames\nLauren Cohan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ September Jones\nLuke Goss ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Carl ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“LukeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Lucas\nRobin Shou ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ 14K\nTanit Phoenix ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Katrina Banks\nFrederick Koehler ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Lists\nJoe Vaz ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ Rocco\n\nGenre: Action | Sci-Fi | Thriller \nLanguage: English \nOriginal Source: avchd 720P \nSize of MP4 file: 1.24 GB (1,342,033,920 bytes) \n\nVideo Specifications:\n\nFormat: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \nBitrate:1362 kbps\nFramerate:23.976 FPS\nEncoder: x264 \nResolution:720x400   \nAspect Ratio: 16:9 \nAdvanced Encoding: 2-Pass Encoding\nQuality Factor (QF) 0.197  \n\nAudio Specifications:\n\nFormat: AAC-LC  \nBitrate: AAC-LC = 128 kbps / AAC 5.1 = 300 kbps \nChannels: AAC-LC= 2 (Stereo) / AAC 5.1 = 6 channels (3/2 .1) \nLanguage: English\nSample Rate: 48000Hz [Both] \nSubtitles:  NONE  \n\n\nPS3, POPCORN HOUR &amp; XBOX 360 COMPATIBLE \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/6_9.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/6_9.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/11_2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/11_2.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/5_19.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/5_19.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15204c105e21dc8fe22216c98a4d353cd2918a84","amp;dn":"Death+Race+2+BRRip+%5BRelease-Lounge+H264%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15204c105e21dc8fe22216c98a4d353cd2918a84","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,32,76,16,94,33,220,143,226,34,22,201,138,77,53,60,210,145,138,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
