Already very popular on the live folk circuit, with this album Little Johnny England have recorded their Liege &amp; Lief, presenting a set of songs that tell stories and get you rocking, while making you think at the same time.\n\nInstrumentally, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s built on a bed of fiddle, mandolin, melodeon, guitars and drums in a most cohesive and tightly balanced unit. Veteran guitarist PJ Wright is among the talented younger players, adding some trademark steel-edged flourishes, but this is very much a band album of tremendous class; memorable and intelligent songs such as Lily Of Barbary, Ginger Billy, Cutthroats, Crooks &amp; Conmen and the title track all stay with you from first play. Well packaged, with an essential lyrics booklet, thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no doubt that this is one of the finest folk-rock albums for decades. Time to rejoice in real quality\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/little-johnny-england/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/little-johnny-england/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2acb8651a8d7402550eab028c96d823b146fbc3","amp;dn":"Little+Johnny+England...Tournament+Of+Shadows%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2acb8651a8d7402550eab028c96d823b146fbc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,172,184,101,26,141,116,2,85,14,171,2,140,150,216,35,177,70,251,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
