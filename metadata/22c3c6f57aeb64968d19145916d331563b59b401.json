Ken senses that Emma would rather be with Will instead of him, so gives the football-playing glee club members an ultimatum by scheduling football practice on the same day as glee rehearsals. Meanwhile, club members Quinn and Finn have grape slushies thrown in their faces by the other students ready to take them down as they are no longer untouchable because of their high status. Their popularity has slipped due to Quinn's pregnancy and their partaking in the glee club. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester falls in love with Rod Remington, one of her local news co-workers, and makes amends with her adversary, Will. Her relationship fails, however when she discovers that Rod is cheating on her. Returning to form, Sue removes Quinn from the cheerleading squad because of her pregnancy. When Puck's mother (Gina Hecht) encourages him to date a Jewish girl, Puck begins to court Rachel. At first she excuses herself by saying she needs a strong male role who can perform a solo. As a result, Puck sings &quot;Sweet Caroline&quot; as his first solo to the glee club, dedicating it to Rachel, sealing the relationship. The two ultimately break up as a result of Rachel's feelings for Finn and Puck's feelings for Quinn. Ken reverses his ultimatum after a conversation with a dismayed Finn, and allows the football players to return to glee club.\n\nI Will Be Uploading All Glee Episodes As Single Files Then All Together (:\nI Will Also Be Uploading All Albums To Each Season (:\n\nEnjoy (: &amp; Please Seed \n\nThanks\n\n- [Np]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c3c6f57aeb64968d19145916d331563b59b401","amp;dn":"Glee+-+S01E08+-+Mash-Up+%5BNp%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c3c6f57aeb64968d19145916d331563b59b401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,195,198,245,122,235,100,150,141,25,20,89,22,211,49,86,59,89,180,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
