It has the glow of a &quot;classic&quot; without being cookie cutter trip-hop, it is actually a fully-fleshed evolution with the key word being &quot;atmosphere&quot;. The influence of dream pop and ambient have worked as a charm. Their other albums are also highly recommended, although the next one after On Black Peak, The Thrill of Fresh Paint, sounds even less like trip-hop...\nThere are two different issues of this album, one of which has track 12 Ghost Dance, and another one has instead Bluebird. I've included both tracks.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. On Black Peak (5:23)\n2. The Prize (6:17)\n3. LJL (4:46)\n4. Candy Bliss (5:38)\n5. So-Fi (1:26)\n6. Half-Life (5:07)\n7. Big Change (5:14)\n8.
