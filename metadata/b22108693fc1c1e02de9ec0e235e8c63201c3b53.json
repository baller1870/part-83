The play, &quot;Deathtrap,&quot; is a five character, two act thriller so perfect in its construction that, as Sidney says, &quot;A gifted director couldn't even hurt it.&quot; Using his penchant for plot, and out of his desperate desire to once again be the toast of Broadway, Sidney, along with Myra, cook up an almost unthinkable scheme: They'll lure the would-be playwright to the Bruhl home, kill him, and market the sure-fire script as Sidney's own. But shortly after Clifford arrives, it's clear that things are not what they seem! Indeed, even Helga Ten Dorp, a nosey psychic from next door, and Porter Milgram, Sidney's observant attorney, can only speculate where the line between truth and deception lies.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b22108693fc1c1e02de9ec0e235e8c63201c3b53","amp;dn":"Deathtrap.1982.DVDRip.Xvid-REJPiST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b22108693fc1c1e02de9ec0e235e8c63201c3b53","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,33,8,105,63,193,193,224,45,233,236,14,35,94,140,99,32,28,59,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
