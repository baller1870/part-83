She has been brought up in a deeply Christian family and her parents have tried to make sure she and her ten brothers and sisters have grown up protected from the sins of the outside world.\n\nDeborah is a bright, confident girl who has big ambitions for her life and the film spends a summer with her as she ventures out in the world to see what life outside her family could be and starts putting her beliefs forward to a wider audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:852a4cd15d8f642688a8500fb8af588d018e3da9","amp;dn":"Deborah+13%3A+Servant+of+God","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"852a4cd15d8f642688a8500fb8af588d018e3da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,42,76,209,93,143,100,38,136,168,80,15,184,175,88,141,1,142,61,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
