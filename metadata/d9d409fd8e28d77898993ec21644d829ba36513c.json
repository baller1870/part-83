Geils Band - Angel in Blue [promo].VOB\n\n\n\nVery HQ rare promo music video. &quot;Angel in Blue&quot; is a song from Freeze-Frame, the 12th album by American rock band The J. Geils Band, released in 1981. The album reached number one on the Billboard 200 album chart in February 1982, and remained at the top for four weeks.\n\nThe J. Geils Band is an American rock band formed in 1967 in Worcester, Massachusetts, best known for its 1981 single, &quot;Centerfold&quot; which charted #1 in the U.S. in early 1982. The band played R&amp;B-influenced blues-rock in the 1970s before moving towards a more pop-influenced sound in the 1980s. Since its initial break-up in 1985, the band has reunited several times.\n\nThe band started as an acoustic blues trio in the mid 1960s, with singer and guitarist John Geils, bassist Danny Klein (Dr. Funk) and harmonica player Richard Salwitz (stage name Magic Dick).\n\nThe band formed under the name 'Snoopy and the Sopwith Camels', while Geils was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute for a couple of semesters. In 1967, the band switched focus, starting to play electric guitar and bass and recruiting drummer Stephen Jo Bladd and fast-talking ex-disc jockey singer Peter Wolf, born Peter Blankenfeld, both from Boston. They became the J. Geils Blues Band, later dropping the word &quot;Blues&quot; from the band name. The following year, former fan Seth Justman joined as an organist. The group signed to Atlantic Records in 1970.\n\nIn September 2010 it was announced that The J. Geils Band was a finalist nominee for selection to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Class Of 2011, but were not selected for induction that year.\n\nThe band attracted special attention for its innovative use of the harmonica as a lead instrument. Magic Dick is still regarded as one of the best lead harmonica players in rock and roll.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_Frame_(The_J._Geils_Band_album)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_Frame_(The_J._Geils_Band_album)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NacPfaAdn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/NacPfaAdn&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:59\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
