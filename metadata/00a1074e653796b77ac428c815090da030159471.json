Michael Hanlon identifies ten scientific questions that we simply can't seem to answer and explains why these compelling mysteries will remain unsolved for years to comeHow did life begin? Why are there two sexes? Where did language originate? In Hanlon's characteristically witty style, he ponders the ways these questions have persisted in frustrating the best minds and asks what might be needed to get to the bottom of it all. From politics to lack of technology, each question has its own set of circumstances holding it back. By exploring these unanswerable questions, Hanlon exposes some of science's greatest failings and missteps--and charts a hopeful direction for getting science back on the road to discovery.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00a1074e653796b77ac428c815090da030159471","amp;dn":"10+Questions+Science+Can%5C%27t+Answer+%28Yet%29%7ERKH%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00a1074e653796b77ac428c815090da030159471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,161,7,78,101,55,150,183,122,196,40,200,21,9,13,160,48,21,148,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
