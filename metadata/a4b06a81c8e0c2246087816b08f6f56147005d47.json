Things improve when he meets Alex - an aspiring model headed for New York - and a fast-talking pal promises to set up the demo. Then new setbacks: Alex isn't faithful, mom rejects him, rifts surface with his friends, and he's mugged by rivals. Everything hinges on the next rap showdown at the club. Can B-Rabbit pull truth out of his cap?\n\nRelease date: 8 November 2002 (USA)\n\nFile size: 750 MB\n\n\n\n\nIMDB Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0298203/\n\nGenre: Drama | Music\n\nCast:\n\n\nCode:\n\nEminem  ...
