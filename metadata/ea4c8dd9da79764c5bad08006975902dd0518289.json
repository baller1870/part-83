It was composed by Holly Knight and Heart band member Nancy Wilson. &quot;There's The Girl&quot; was released in a remixed version as the third single from Heart's ninth studio album, Bad Animals. Knight is known as a very successful songwriter who was responsible for penning many hit singles during the 1980s.\n\nLike Heart's 1986 #1 single &quot;These Dreams&quot;, the lead vocals on &quot;There's the Girl&quot; were performed by Nancy Wilson, rather than Ann Wilson, the usual lead singer for the group. The single climbed to #12 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and was also a Top-40 single on the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #34.\n\nThe 7&quot; version was remixed from &quot;Bad Animals&quot; and ran for 3:50, whilst the 12&quot; and CD single version featured an extended remix, running at 7:22. A very limited edition of the UK 12&quot; single release came with a giant double-sided poster.\n\nThe most highly sought after release format of this single is, however, the Japanese 3&quot; CD single, which exclusivey featured an extended version of Heart's previous single &quot;Alone&quot; running at 5:45. This track is only available on this release.\n\nBad Animals was the ninth studio album, but tenth album overall by the band Heart. Released in 1987, the album was a big hit, and was almost as successul as their previous record Heart in 1985. RIAA ceritfication as of 2010 is 5 times platinum, indicating sales in excess of 5 million in the US alone. The album reached #2 on the Billboard album charts. It contained the number one hit single &quot;Alone&quot;, whilst &quot;Who Will You Run To&quot; reached #7, &quot;There's the Girl&quot; reached #12, and &quot;I Want You So Bad&quot; reached #47. The album is notable for containing only 4 tracks with writing contributions from lead members Ann and Nancy Wilson.\n\nHeart is a rock band whose founding members came from Seattle, Washington, USA in the early 1970s. Going through several lineup changes, the only constant members of the group are sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. The group rose to fame in the 1970s with their music being influenced by hard rock as well as folk music. After diminishing in popularity for a couple of years in the early 80s, the band enjoyed a massive comeback in 1985, experiencing further successes with their power ballads and pop hits throughout the rest of that decade and into the 90s.\n\nOver their four decade career, Heart has had chart successes with a wide variety of musical styles, ranging from hard rock and metal (Barracuda, If Looks Could Kill, Black on Black II), to folk rock (Dreamboat Annie, Love Alive, Dog and Butterfly), to power ballads (Alone, These Dreams, What About Love). With both Jupiter's Darling in 2004 and their latest release Red Velvet Car in August 2010, Heart made a return to their hard rock/acoustic roots of the late 70s.\n\nTo date, Heart has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea4c8dd9da79764c5bad08006975902dd0518289","amp;dn":"Heart+-+There%5C%27s+The+Girl+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea4c8dd9da79764c5bad08006975902dd0518289","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,76,141,217,218,121,118,76,91,173,8,0,105,117,144,45,208,81,130,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
