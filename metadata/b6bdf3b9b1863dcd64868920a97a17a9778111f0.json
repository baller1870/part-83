BenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s secret identity has been revealed to the world and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s now an international mega-star super hero, loved by kids all over the world over but distrusted by many adults. Armed with a mysterious new Ultimatrix, Ben is able to transform into ultimate versions of his aliens and will see action in places heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s never been.\n\nBen 10: Ultimate Alien - Volume 1\n\n101-Fame\nBen's secret identity is revealed to the entire world, and he is now a superhero loved everywhere by kids and teenagers, but distrusted by many adults.\n\n102-Duped\nBen needs to be in three places at once; he has to fight the Forever Knights with Kevin, go to Julie's tennis game, and see a Sumo Slammers movie. Using Echo Echo, he divides himself into three copies and transforms back into human form, creating three of himself.\n\n103-Hit 'em Where they Live\nBen's enemies are targeting his parents now that he's famous. Max, unable to deal with them alone following a fight with Sevenseven, has to enlist Ben's aid.\n\n104-Video Games\nBen's celebrity status lands him in a starring role in a video game. Using motion capture technology, they record the moves of his various alien forms to integrate them into the game.\n\n105-Escape from Aggregor\nThe turtle-like alien Galapagus is causing a rampage in Bellwood, he explains that he determined this to be the easiest method of finding Ben.\n\n106-Too Hot to Handle\nP'andor (one of the aliens who were captured by Aggregor) offers a huge cash reward to anyone who can break him out of his containment suit. Kevin decides to take the job, only to back out upon learning that P'andor is highly radioactive.\n\n107-Andreas' Fault\nWhen Ben, Kevin, and Gwen investigate an odd string of thefts by the Forever Knights, they learn that Argit is using Andreas (one of the aliens being hunted by Aggregor) to frighten them into making him their leader.\n\n108-Fused\nAfter ambushing Ben at his house, Ra'ad (the fifth and last of the aliens captured by Aggregor) after a short fight is thrown into a pool by Jetray. Electrocuted, he awakes in Los Selodad and blames Ben for letting Aggregor recapture the other four aliens.\n\n109-Hero Time\nBen saves actress Jennifer Nocturne from a group of thugs and she is immediately smitten with him, much to Julie's chagrin. However, Ben's only interest is in Captain Nemesis, who shows up moments after Ben defeats the thugs.\n\n110-Ultimate Aggregor\nWith all five aliens in his possession, Aggregor tries to return to his home planet Osmos to absorb all of their powers. A Plumber ambush damages his ship, so he instead heads for Los Soledad in order to use Paradox's time machine as an alternate power source.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease share....Don't hit and run...Seed it back at least once.\n\nOf course, if you want to seed it back more than once, that would be ok too :)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6bdf3b9b1863dcd64868920a97a17a9778111f0","amp;dn":"Ben+10%3A+Ultimate+Alien+-+Volume+1+%282010%29+DVDRip+Xvid+Eng+AC3+AVI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6bdf3b9b1863dcd64868920a97a17a9778111f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,189,243,185,177,134,61,205,100,134,137,32,169,122,23,169,119,129,17,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
