They do some songwriting, \nbut their specialty seems to be a balanced mix of very tasty interpretations \nof early classic rock n' roll, ballads, blues, and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nHamster Jam is a high energy live recording, 57+ minutes of hard rockin' early \nclassic rock, rock 'n roll, and Hendrix favorites. \n\nThey bypassed the ballads for this recording, and just keep cranking out rockers. \n\nThere's little let up from start to finish, there's a good bit of straight \nrock 'n roll, but plenty of blues-rock as well, all of it featuring excellent \nguitar support. \n\nBlues-rock guitar affectionados will not be disappointed with this disc, they do \nrelax a bit for the start of Jimi's &quot;Red House&quot;, but before for long this builds \ninto one of the more intense songs on the disc.\n\nRounding out the varied selection of popular classics and originals, are some great \nsounding, less frequently heard cover tunes like Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But Trash&quot; \nand &quot;Wild Thing&quot;.\n\nThere are five Hendrix flavored songs on the CD, and I really enjoy The Hamsters \ninterpretation of Jimi's music.\n\nTheir approach to the Hendrix style is plenty agressive, but without the excessive \nfeedback, over-extended lead breaks, and other over-done pyrotechnics that sometimes \naccompany Hendrix's covers. \n\nIn fact, this to the point playing style carries through most of the CD.\n__________\n\n1 - Only Rock' n' Roll.\n\n2 - The Gangster Of Love.\n\n3 - Manic Depression.\n\n4 - Cadillac Walk.\n\n5 - Highway Chile.\n\n6 - Ju Ju Man.\n\n7 - Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But Trash.\n\n8 - Crosstown Traffic.\n\n9 - Wild Thing.\n\n10 - The Queen.\n\n11 - Crossroads.\n\n12 - Red House.\n\n13 - Can't Stop Rockin'.\n\n14 - Barefoot Rock.\n\n15 - Romeo's Escape.\n__________\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFile size : 8.17 MiB\nDuration : 3mn 34s\nOverall bit rate : 320 Kbps\nAlbum : (1992) Hamster Jam\nTrack name : Only Rock' N' Roll\nTrack name/Position : 1\nPerformer : The Hamsters\nWriting library : LAME3.92\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nDuration : 3mn 34s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nStream size : 8.17 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : LAME3.92\n__________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6844116c66b60a10a692871c0b514b77f50da4","amp;dn":"The+HamstersThe+Hamsters%281992%29Hamster+Jam%5D%5Bmp3+320kbs%5D%5BICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6844116c66b60a10a692871c0b514b77f50da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,104,68,17,108,102,182,10,16,166,146,135,28,11,81,75,119,245,13,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
