It's not moving and not responding to    \n       radio contact. Yachtsmen have become a favourite target for       \n    pirates. Have they struck again? A merchant vessel is broken down    \n       and a sitting duck, Toowoomba races to the scene to try and       \n     protect it. Disaster strikes Toowoomba is dead in the water. A      \n      propeller is snagged with nets and rope from one of the many       \n      fishing operating in the area. Divers work for hours in heavy      \n      swell and shark-infested waters to try and untangle the mess.      \n    Finally it's time to return home. The crew is reunited with their    \n   loved ones.
