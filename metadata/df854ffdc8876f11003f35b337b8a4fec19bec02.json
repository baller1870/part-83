In the mid 1960s, Piazza formed his first band The House of DBS, which later changed its name to the Dirty Blues Band. The band signed with ABC-Bluesway and released two albums in 1967 and 1968. The band broke up in 1968, and Piazza formed Bacon Fat that year. Piazza's idol and mentor, George &quot;Harmonica&quot; Smith  joined the band and they had a &quot;dual harp&quot; sound. Bacon Fat released two albums the following two years. The Los Angeles' blues band Bacon Fat was essentially a vehicle for Rod Piazza and his superb `chromatic' harmonica playing - loud, live and gutsy! The band line-up on this disc includes Buddy Reed and Gregg Schaefer on guitars, J.D. Nicholson on Piano with Jerry Smith on bass and Dick Innes on drums. \n\nA monumental audio document in the history of the Los Angeles' blues scene. This is during a stage when elder statesman like Smith and J.D. Nicholson taught the nuances of the trade to youngsters Piazza and Richard Innes. For Piazza, it shows him in an embryonic stage in his career, displaying his potential while still learning\n\nTracklist\n01. Up The Line [0:04:15.23]\n02. Boom Boom [0:03:48.23]\n03.
