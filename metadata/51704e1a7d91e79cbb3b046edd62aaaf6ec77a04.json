Shappi also chats to Lenny Henry, Ken Livingstone and Ben Okri.\n\n[quote]Her father, as many know, was a satirist who got into the sort of trouble satirists get into in Iran. &quot;The regime there robustly advocates free speech,&quot; Khorsandi said, &quot;but there is no freedom after you've exercised it. He criticised the mullahs and things became a bit ... death-y.&quot;\n\nThe Khorsandis went into exile in Britain - &quot;A fatwa is the closest thing an Iranian writer gets to a literary prize&quot; - where, of course, Khorsandi has now become a glittering addition to the comedic firmament. And a published author. &quot;I said to my Dad: 'I've written a book.' He said: 'Has anyone threatened to kill you?' And I said no and he said: 'Then it can't be very good.'&quot; [/quote]\n\n\nShappi Talk - S01 - E01 - Racism\nShappi Talk - S01 - E02 - Parents\nShappi Talk - S01 - E03 - Religion\nShappi Talk - S01 - E04 - Growing-Up\n\nShappi Talk - S02 - E01 - Single Mum\nShappi Talk - S02 - E02 - Addiction\nShappi Talk - S02 - E03 - History\nShappi Talk - S02 - E04 - Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration        : 28mn 1s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n\nYou can add this line\n\n \n\nInto uTorrent on the left under FEEDS\nuTorrent will show &quot;My&quot; newly posted torrents ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51704e1a7d91e79cbb3b046edd62aaaf6ec77a04","amp;dn":"Shappi+Talk+-+S01+%26+02+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51704e1a7d91e79cbb3b046edd62aaaf6ec77a04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,112,78,26,125,145,231,156,187,59,4,110,221,98,170,175,110,199,122,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
