Grave Wave noun:\nA term used to describe the recent musical upswing of all things dark and deathly. Encompasses witch house, post punk, neofolk, EBM, death rock, goth, electro, 80s revivalists, batcave purists, et al. Frequently accompanied by a strong graphic aesthetic: symbols, videos, visual and performance art. Sometimes creeps into the mainstream (see: Cold Cave, The Horrors). Sometimes remains purposefully under-underground (see: twYlY&lt; ght &gt;ZoNe).
