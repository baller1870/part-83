WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll also hear from conservative columnist Ann Coulter.\n\nAlso: This yearÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s election restored divided government. That should make us libertarians happy, right? ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a start, but Tucker Carlson tells me we shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t expect much to change.\n\nFinally, some good news for liberty. The Supreme Court said citizens can trash politicians. And that people in cities can own guns. And Fox Business got a new libertarian TV show ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ not just mine, but Freedom Watch with Judge Andrew Napolitano. He joins the program to tell me how liberty fared in the courts this year.\n\nThe show re-airs tomorrow at 9 p.m. &amp; 12 midnight EST, and Sunday at 9 p.m. EST.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e9ba21b1782570c7023d94d606668d81538cc8e","amp;dn":"20101209-Stossel-%5BLiberty+in+2010%5D-Fox+Business.CF.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e9ba21b1782570c7023d94d606668d81538cc8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,155,162,27,23,130,87,12,112,35,217,77,96,102,104,216,21,56,204,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
