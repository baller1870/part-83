Of course, any sane person would hurry to delete the archives as soon as they unpack it; ergo, no more seeding.\nLet's solve this plague: I uploaded here the full MKV, so you can keep the actual usable content AND keep on seeding for as long as you wish, if you like the movie. I'm sure you will; starts a bit... sordid, classic society drifting in search of lost values, but it picks up and... I won't say anymore, don't wanna spoil it. But please, be sure to *listen* to the soundtrack in the best conditions you're able to achieve; worth it, and the high IMDB score would be justified if only for the music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c07dcda81e73cde8b92189496f9ebc2aa918c18","amp;dn":"Le+Concert+%282009%2C+BluRay+rip%2C+no+RARs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c07dcda81e73cde8b92189496f9ebc2aa918c18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,7,220,218,129,231,60,222,139,146,24,148,150,249,235,194,170,145,140,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
