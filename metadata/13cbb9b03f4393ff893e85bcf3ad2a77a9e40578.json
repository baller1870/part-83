He combined dance hall style and lyrics with his own streetwise tongue-twisters to literally leave crowds in awe. This guy was simply on another level.\n\nFrom Fulham in south west London, he came up through the acid techno scene in the late 80's and early 90's first making an impact with the release of techno ragga alongside appolo 440. After that he started getting bookings for raves like Telepathy, Labyrinth, Elevation and Utopia.\n\nHe soon became the main event MC'ing alongside the likes of Micky Finn and Nicky Blackmarket and was the first name punters looked for at any DnB event. By 1995 he was the biggest MC in the game and destined to break into the mainstream getting booked all over the UK and smashing up Kool FM and other regional pirates.\n\nTragedy struck on July 4th 1998, Stevie Hyper D died of a heart attack the morning after performing at a rave in Maidstone, Kent, coincidently on the same night as friend and fellow MC Ruff. Many rumours surfaced around the time of Stevie's death, but it is widely accepted that he died as a result of a pre existing heart condition. The scene had lost two of its biggest soldiers and they have been sorely missed ever since. Even now his tribute raves are sell out roadblock events and his name still rings out from mc's across the world paying their respect.\n\nSource : www.mcdirectory.info/2010/09/mc-stevie-hyper-d-rip.html[/b]\n\n[i][b][color=red]Contents:[/color][/b] [/i] \n[b] Hysteria Legends 1996 Vol 2\nKool FM\nAndy C - Hyper D @ Telepathy 3 1994\nAndy C - Hyper D, Det, Fearless @ Slammin Vinyl 6th Sep 1997\nAndy C - Hyper D, MC Det, Skibadee @ Telepathy 1997 (Including Sick Radio Advert)\nAndy C @ One Nation 1997 (Bonus CD - World Domination)\nBrockie - Hyper D @ Telepathy 3 1994\nBrockie - Hyper D, Det @ Slammin Vinyl\nBrockie &amp; Jumping Jack Frost @ One Nation The 'Biggest &amp; Best I' 1997\nCool Hand Flex @ Telepathy New Years Extravaganza\nDarren Jay - Hyper D @ Helter Skelter\nDarren Jay @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997 (Side A)\nDarren Jay @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997 (Side B )\nDarren Jay @ One Nation 'Clash Of The Titans' 1996\nHype -  Hyper D @ Innovation 1995 (Side A)\nHype -  Hyper D @ Innovation 1995 (Side B )\nHype B2B Randall - Hyper D, GQ @ Heat May 1996 (Side A)\nHype B2B Randall - Hyper D, GQ @ Heat May 1996 (Side B )\nJumping Jack Frost - Hyper D @ Desire 'Rezerection' 1998\nJumping Jack Frost - Hyper D @ Helter Skelter NYE\nJumping Jack Frost - Hyper D @ Telepathy 3 1994\nJumping Jack Frost - Hyper D, Fearless @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997\nJumping Jack Frost - Hyper D, Navi, Moose @ Roast\nKemistry - Hyper D @ Telepathy\nKenny Ken - Hyper D @ Mach One (Side A)\nKenny Ken - Hyper D @ Mach One (Side B )\nKenny Ken - Hyper D @ Slammin Vinyl 1996\nKenny Ken @ Roast 'Final Chapter'\nKenny Ken @ Slamming Vinyl 1998\nMampi Swift - Hyper D, 5ive-O, Navigator, Fats Ragga Twins @ Desert Storm 1994 (Side A)\nMampi Swift - Hyper D, 5ive-O, Navigator, Fats Ragga Twins @ Desert Storm 1994 (Side B )\nMampi Swift - Hyper D, 5ive-O, Shabba @ Telepathy 1997\nMickey Finn - Hyper D @ Telepathy 1994\nMickey Finn - Hyper D, Det, Skibadee @ Roast 1997\nMickey Finn - Hyper D, Skibadee @ Desire 1997\nMickey Finn - Hyper D, Skibba, Det @ Roast\nMickey Finn @ Meditation X-Mas Special (Side A)\nMickey Finn @ Meditation X-Mas Special (Side B )\nMickey Finn @ One Nation 1996\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D - Stevies Last Ever Set 1998 (Side A)\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D - Stevies Last Ever Set 1998 (Side B )\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Amazon 1997\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ BBC Radio 1, One In The Jungle 1996\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ BBC Radio 1, One In The Jungle 1997\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Countdown to Armagedden 1998 Pt. 1\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Countdown to Armagedden 1998 Pt. 2\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Countdown to Armagedden 1998 Pt. 3\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Countdown to Armagedden 1998 Pt. 4\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Liquid Adrenaline 1998\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ One Nation 1997\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D @ Roast Oct 1995\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D, Det @ One Nation Valentines Experience Part 5\nNicky Blackmarket - Hyper D, Shortston @ Slamming Vinyl 5th Sep 1997\nNicky Blackmarket &amp; Brockie - Hyper D, Bassman, Trigga, Det, Shabba @ Hysteria 16 1997\nNicky Blackmarket &amp; Clarkee - Hyper D @ Don FM 100.5FM Sept 1994\nNicky Blackmarket &amp; SS - Hyper D, Fearless, Skibba @ One Nation (Side A)\nNicky Blackmarket &amp; SS - Hyper D, Fearless, Skibba @ One Nation (Side B )\nNicky Blackmarket @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997 (Side A)\nNicky Blackmarket @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997 (Side B )\nNicky Blackmarket @ Hysteria 20 1998 (Side B )\nNicky Blackmarket @ One Nation Valentines Experience Part 5\nNicky Blackmarket @ Roast 'Land Of The Giants 4' 1997\nPhantasy - Hyper D, Fearless @ Desire 'Rezerection' 1998\nRandall -  Hyper D, Skibba, Bassman @ One Nation US of DnB 1997\nRandall - Hyper D, MC MC, Ryme Tyme @ Jungle Mania\nRandall &amp; Mickey Finn - Hyper D, Fats, Navi @ Meditation X-Mas Special 1996 (Side B )\nRay Keith - Hyper D, MC MC, Princey  Micro @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997 (Side A)\nRay Keith - Hyper D, MC MC, Princey  Micro @ Helter Skelter Energy 1997 (Side B )\nRay Keith &amp; Nicky Blackmarket @ One Nation 1996\nRay Keith @ Telepathy 3 1994\nSS B2B Funky Flirt - Hyper D, Det @ Telepathy 1998 (Side A)\nStevie Hyper D - Collectors Special Edition (bonus live cd)\nZinc - Hyper D @ Slamming Vinyl 5th Aug 1998 (Side A)\nZinc - Hyper D @ Slamming Vinyl 5th Aug 1998 (Side B )[/b]\n\n[i][b][color=red]Genre:[/color][/i][/b] [b] Drum n Bass [/b]\n[i][b][color=red]Language:[/color][/i][/b] [b] English [/b]\n[i][b][color=red]Original Source:[/color][/b][/i] [b] Mainly Sourced From 'Drum And Bass Arena' - Massive Thanks!

Time was spent gathering these and then tidying up the file's ie Names/Artist/Albums etc so it looks nice in your Itunes. These MP3 were mostly gathered from rips of 'Cassette Tapes' hence some of the mp3s are not amazing quality, but you wouldnt throw away a rough diamond. A massive thanks goes out to the people who originally ripped these from their Tapes, without them this collection would not be possible. If you have additional Stevie Hyper D tapes, please rip them to MP3 (google this if you dont know how) up them to a site likeand contact us at Release lounge and we will see about updating this torrent in the future. \nThe man should be remembered by everyone, whether you were there or not.\n\nStevie Hyper D - Rest In Peace   [/i]\n\n[img]http://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/hyperd1.jpg[/img] [img]http://release-lounge.com/imghost/images/ReleaseLoungeRG/hyperd3.jpg[/img]\n\n[b][color=red]Info Hash:13CBB9B03F4393FF893E85BCF3AD2A77A9E40578[/color] \n[color=red]Tracker Announce:[/color] [code]http://exodus.1337x.org/announce &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nemesis.1337x.org/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce[/code]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://tracker.publicbt.com/announce[/code]&lt;/a&gt; \n\n[color=red]Drum And Bass Arena : www.breakbeat.co.uk/[/color]  [/b]\n\n[i][color=&quot;red&quot;][b]Release-Lounge Team : [/b][/i][/color][color=&quot;gold&quot;][b] Simms, Darren S, Age, UpGrayyed, Elguaco, Grumbles, Legion, and special thanks to Paulx1, Calka and KK[/color][/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13cbb9b03f4393ff893e85bcf3ad2a77a9e40578","amp;dn":"MC+Stevie+Hyper+D+MP3+Collection+%5BA+Release-Lounge+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13cbb9b03f4393ff893e85bcf3ad2a77a9e40578","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,203,185,176,63,67,147,255,137,62,133,188,243,173,42,119,169,228,5,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
