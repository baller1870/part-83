He became interested in folk music and rock &amp; roll in his teens while attending Hammersmith College and in 1965 began performing under the name Steve Adams. Mike Hurst, a former member of the folk-pop group the Springfields, who had become a record producer, heard him and took him into a recording studio to cut his composition &quot;I Love My Dog.&quot; This demo caused Decca Records to sign him under the name Cat Stevens and assign him to its newly formed Deram subsidiary. &quot;I Love My Dog&quot; reached the British charts in October 1966, peaking in the Top 40. Stevens' next single, &quot;Matthew &amp; Son,&quot; entered the charts in January 1967 and just missed getting to number one (in America, it grazed the bottom of the charts). It was another self-written effort, and Stevens' reputation as a writer was further enhanced by the success of his song &quot;Here Comes My Baby,&quot; which was recorded by the Tremeloes and entered the British charts in February, reaching the Top Five. (In America, it peaked just outside the Top Ten.)\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\t\t\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\n01.The Wind\n02.Wild World\n03.Oh Very Young\n04.Where Do The Children Play\n05.Hard Headed Woman\n06.Moonshadow\n07.Peace Train\n08.Father And Son\n09.Sitting\n10.How Can I Tell You\n11.Morning Has Broken\n12.The First Cut Is The Deepest\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7a4c3b46673afccab75c918b8b79b38c0164e72","amp;dn":"Cevens++-+20th+Century+Masters+Best+Of+%282007%29+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7a4c3b46673afccab75c918b8b79b38c0164e72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,164,195,180,102,115,175,204,171,117,201,24,184,183,155,56,192,22,78,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
