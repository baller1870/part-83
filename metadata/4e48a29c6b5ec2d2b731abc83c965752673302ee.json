Many commercial big-hitters are sidelined in favour of underground tracks that made their mark in the clubs, on the streets and in the record collections of the more discerning listener.\n\nHed Kandi head honcho Mark Doyle says: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCD 1 kicks off with 2 soulful classics from the slightly obscure Ceybil Jeffries and the absolutely huge Robert Owens. Moving on, Inner City need no introduction and both Pamela Fernandez and Nicole may not sound overly familiar but one listen will take you straight back to a dancefloor in 1990. MalaikaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSo Much In LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ may be new to many people but it was one of my favourites and was missed by a lot of people when it was released.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWe raise the classic factor further with tracks by Little Louis, The Fog, Ten City and Colourblind. The penultimate track is a rare treat ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a completely unreleased track by Degrees Of Motion. After their success with ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œShine OnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDo You Want It Right NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCelebrateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ never received a full release. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only through our relationship with Eric Kupper that we were able to contact Richie Jones and secure this track for the compilation (side note to my little ramble here but Back To Love is a constant reminder of what a legend our good friend Mr Kupper isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ just look at the production credits for many of the tracks weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve included during this series and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see EricÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name time and time again). We close CD1 with a hands in the air Chicago house piano anthem the timeless ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBetter DaysÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ by Jimi Polo and move on to CD2.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAs always CD2 is a mixture of goodtime tunes that donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stick to any set style but were the tracks that dropped near the end of the night purely for the reaction of the crowd. The first few are fairly relaxed but still goosebump-raising soulful anthems, from Chante Moore to The Brand New Heavies each track is a hands-in-the-air-on-the-dancefloor-with-your-friends anthem. The next few tracks add a bit of party attitude kicking off with Neneh CherryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBuffalo StanceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and finishing with Sugarbear ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Scandalize Mine.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The close of the night (and the CD) is all about the party and IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m so happy to finally be able to include Sister Sledge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThinking Of You.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ That is swiftly followed by another soul anthem from Skipworth and Turner and the CD closes with a rare disco classic from Chicago.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThis edition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ the seventh in the series ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is shaping up to be one of the best ever, and with Hed KandiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s profile just about to launch into full throttle over the Ibiza season, Back To Love will be finding its way onto many a sun-kissed stereo this summer.\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\nCD1\nCeybil Jeffries Open Your Heart (Extended Remix)\nRobert Owens IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Be Your Friend (David Morales DEF Mix)\nInner City Big Fun (Original 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Mix)\nPamela Fernandez KickinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ In The Beat (Extended Dance Mix)\nNicole Rock The House (Club Mix)\nMalaika So Much In Love (Choice Mix)\nLittle Louis &amp; Marc Anthony Ride On The Rhythm\nThe Fog Been A Long Time (GioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Doped Mix)\nTen City Right Back To You (Extended Mix)\nColourblind Nothing Better (TMVS Club Mix)\nDegrees Of Motion Celebrate (12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Mix)\nJimi Polo Better Days (Original 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Club Mix)\n\nCD2\nChante Moore LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Taken Over (Extended vocal)\nThe Sounds Of Blackness IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m Going All The Way\nAbsolute (2) Introduce Me To Love (Original 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Mix)\nMr Fingers What About This Love (Extended Version)\nFrankie Knuckles ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hard Sometimes(FKClassicClub)\nBrand New Heavies Stay This Way (Heavy Mix)\nNeneh Cherry Buffalo Stance (Fast Pop Mix)\nNWA Express Yourself (Album Version)\nA Tribe Called Quest Can I Kick It\nSugarbear DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Scandalize Mine\nSister Sledge Thinking Of You (Album Mix)\nSkipworth &amp; Turner Thinking About Your Love\nChicago Street Player (Album Mix)\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/ENJOY.gif[/IMG]\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/abc8/bb92e608.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e48a29c6b5ec2d2b731abc83c965752673302ee","amp;dn":"++Hed+Kandi+back+to+Love+2010%28%40SSDJ%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e48a29c6b5ec2d2b731abc83c965752673302ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,72,162,156,107,94,194,210,183,49,171,200,60,150,87,82,103,51,2,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
