I was able to derive these files with some difficulty from the &quot;Digital Leisure&quot; torrent that has only the .vob files, and decided to share to save others the trouble. You must have a current updated installation of the Daphne laserdisc game emulator from  www.daphne-emu.com to use this.\n\nFollow the readme.txt file for installation.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\nSpace Ace is a laserdisc video game produced by Don Bluth Studios, Cinematronics, and Advanced Microcomputer Systems (later renamed RDI Video Systems). It was unveiled in October 1983, just four months after the Dragon's Lair game, then released in Spring 1984, and like its predecessor featured film-quality animation played back from a laserdisc.\n\nThe gameplay too is similar, requiring the player to move the joystick or press the fire button at key moments in the animated sequences to govern the hero's actions. However, the game's action was more varied with the player occasionally given the temporary option to either have the character he is controlling transform back into his adult form, or remain as a boy with different styles of challenges.\n\nEnjoy.\nComments / thanks welcome.
