Entering a windowless room, an Invigilator gives them eighty minutes to answer one simple question. He outlines three rules they must obey or be disqualified: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers and don't leave the room. He starts the clock and leaves. The candidates turn over their question papers, only to find they're completely blank. After the initial confusion has subsided, one frustrated candidate writes 'I believe you should hire me because...,' and is promptly ejected for spoiling. The remaining candidates soon figure out they're permitted to talk to each other, and they agree to cooperate in order to figure out the question: then they can compete to answer it. At first they suspect the question may be hidden in their papers like a security marker in a credit card, and they figure out ways to change their environment to expose the hidden words. But light, liquids and other plans all come to naught. Soon enough, the candidates begin to uncover each other's background, prejudices and hidden agendas. Tensions rise as the clock steadily descends towards zero, and each candidate must decide how far they are willing to go to secure the ultimate job . . .\n\n\nVideo\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 1h 41mn\nBit rate : 854 Kbps\nWidth : 704 pixels\nHeight : 304 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 2.35:1\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nColor space : YUV\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\nScan type : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.166\nStream size : 618 MiB (88%)\nWriting library : XviD 57\n\n\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nMode extension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 41mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 101 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 112 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\nStream size : 73.1 MiB (10%)\nAlignment : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\nInterleave, preload duration : 514 ms\nWriting library : LAME3.97 \n\nTrailer\n\nIMDB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1258197/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nShout out to noir and all my freinds @ 1337x.org and extratorrent\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n================================== &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/hiest&lt;/a&gt;\n==================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreens:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91166689565866713453.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/91166689565866713453.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:679dd7f647e592775c34425e801c9a47395fb823","amp;dn":"Exam+%282009%29+DvdRip+%5BXvid%5D+%7B1337x%7D-X","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"679dd7f647e592775c34425e801c9a47395fb823","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,157,215,246,71,229,146,119,92,52,66,94,128,28,154,71,57,95,184,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
