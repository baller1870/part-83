Bradley Roback (Damien A. Maruscak) returns home from active duty after a mysterious accident leaves him paralyzed. Awaiting his return, his mother, Karmen (Camille Keaton), and younger sister, Ashley (Jade Risser), remain unaware of the details of the accident and severity of Brad's condition. Once he arrives, though he looks sickly, his family members are pleased to see him alive and dont bring attention to his ill appearance. Over the next twenty-six hours Brads condition terribly worsens, barreling down to a gruesome conclusion that will change the family forever.\n\nOfficial site: http://www.toetagpictures.com/\n\nREVIEW FROM IMDB:\n\nWow... This movie was off the hook, although it wasn't very exciting the entire time because (I feel) it is meant to be more of a dramatic type horror film, which is something TOETAG has never done before. Everything builds up to the action, and it makes it so much better to see it all happen... You get to see Bradley progress through his sickness within about 24 hours of him and his family being together again. I personally believe this is TOETAG's greatest film ever, and they really took a new approach to making movies with this one, and tried something they hadn't done before... This movie has made me look at TOETAG a different way than I already did... I thought I loved them before, but I must say, I now truly do.\n\nThe story is amazing, and although it wasn't necessarily 'original', it was in ways and kept me very interested the whole time through. The characters were all great, and Damien Maruscak did excellent as Bradley.\n\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2861/vlcsnap2011011009h49m42.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/2861/vlcsnap2011011009h49m42.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/1310/vlcsnap2011011009h50m08.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/1310/vlcsnap2011011009h50m08.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/3450/vlcsnap2011011009h51m51.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img402.imageshack.us/img402/3450/vlcsnap2011011009h51m51.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSEED AND ENJOY FOLKS!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d00ce83a81afd0ec71159da564cfc6c7870f98e","amp;dn":"Sella+Turcica+%282010%29+-+DVD+Screener","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d00ce83a81afd0ec71159da564cfc6c7870f98e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,0,206,131,168,26,253,14,199,17,89,218,86,76,252,108,120,112,249,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
