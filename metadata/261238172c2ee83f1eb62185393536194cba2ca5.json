Their debut single, &quot;He Better Be Dead,&quot; was released to radio on July 12, 2010, and debuted at number 59 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. It is the lead-off single to their upcoming debut album, produced by Paul Worley and set to be released in early 2011 via Skyville Records, which was launched by Worley and Nashville hit songwriter and producer Wally Wilson.\n\nStealing Angels was founded in 2007 when Caroline Cutbirth, Tayla Lynn, and Jennifer Wayne were recruited for a reality show titled All in the Genes, which would focus on the ups and downs of the descendants of famous relatives; Cutbirth is a descendant of Daniel Boone, Jennifer Wayne is John Wayne's granddaughter, and Tayla Lynn is the granddaughter of Loretta Lynn. Wayne was a tennis player in her childhood, and was signed to a label founded by Merv Griffin, but this deal was canceled after Griffin's 2007 death. She met Cutbirth in Nashville, Tennessee in 2007, and the two later met Lynn when the three were asked to participate in a reality television show focusing on the three girls' ancestry. Although the show was never produced, the three began performing together and named themselves Stealing Angels.\n\nStealing Angels signed to Skyville Records, a label founded by record producer Paul Worley. The trio's debut single, &quot;He Better Be Dead&quot;, debuted at number 59 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Country Songs chart for the week of July 17, 2010. Lynn told Country Weekly that the song idea came from a conversation she was having about her boyfriend.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:261238172c2ee83f1eb62185393536194cba2ca5","amp;dn":"Stealing+Angels+-+He+Better+Be+Dead+%28mp4-2nafish%291080p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"261238172c2ee83f1eb62185393536194cba2ca5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,18,56,23,44,46,232,63,30,182,33,133,57,53,54,25,76,186,44,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
