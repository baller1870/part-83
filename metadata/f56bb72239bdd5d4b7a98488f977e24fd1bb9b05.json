Ancient writers agreed that it was fought somewhere near the city of Irbil in northern Iraq, but the exact location has never been discovered.\n\nUsing dramatic new finds in the UK ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a cuneiform clay tablet in the British Museum and a papyrus dug up in Egypt ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Michael sheds new light on the course of events. Then to reconstruct the campaign, he follows AlexanderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s route through Damascus and Alleppo to the river Euphrates in Syria and travels into Northern Iraq with the British and US military.\n\nExploring a landscape long barred to outsiders by Saddam Hussein, he carries out a detailed reconnaissance on the ground with US forces on patrol between Mosul and Kurdistan.\n\nAccompanied by the Head of British forces in Iraq, General Sir Rob Fry, he pieces together the dramatic events that led to this ancient War of the Worlds, and finally, with the help of Kurdish villagers, solves a mystery that has baffled historians and archaeologists for centuries.\n\nMaya Vision &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mayavisionint.com/Catalogue/Alexander's_Greatest_Battle.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mayavisionint.com/Catalogue/Alexander's_Greatest_Battle.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Specs\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC\nVideo Bitrate: 1600 Kbps\nVideo Resolution: 832x468\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nAudio Codec: AAC\nAudio Bitrate: 132 Kbps VBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 48mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 595 MB\nSubtitles: none\nSource: DVB-S (Military Channel)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f56bb72239bdd5d4b7a98488f977e24fd1bb9b05","amp;dn":"HC+Alexander%5C%27s+Greatest+Battle+PDTV+x264+AAC+MVGroup+2009","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f56bb72239bdd5d4b7a98488f977e24fd1bb9b05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,107,183,34,57,189,213,212,183,169,132,136,249,119,226,79,209,187,155,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
