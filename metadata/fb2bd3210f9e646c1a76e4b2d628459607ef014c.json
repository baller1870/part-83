They praised the &quot;super vocals&quot; of Isaac Isaacson and the &quot;outrageous Malmsteen/LeTekro shred&quot; of guitarist Johnny Ohlin. Powerplay called Nation &quot;very classy&quot;. Of Isaacson they said his &quot;exhilarating vocals are especially noteworthy&quot; and concluded that &quot;They typify the high calibre of bands that are being attracted to Now &amp; Then at the moment.&quot;.\n\n--`-`-(@\n\nPersonnel:\n\nJohnny Ohlin guitar, backing vocals\n\nAnders Wallberg drums, backing vocals\n\nMagnus 'Nobby' Norberg bass, backing vocals\n\nIsaac Isaacson lead and backing vocals\n\nKalle Carlsson keyboards\n\n--`-`-(@\n\n01.

FÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶r den som gillar Yngwierock alÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ 80-tal ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r Nation fantastiskt bra. Allt ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤r oklanderligt spelat, produktionen pompÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s och snygg och sÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ngaren som jag hackade pÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥ tidigare har blivit riktigt bra.Omodernt, men bra och &quot;Waterloo&quot; har blivit roligt uppruggad...\n\n\nNATION is a very, very powerful sounding band. Each and every song on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWithout RemorseÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a heavy metal hit! The musicianship featured on it is outrageous. The way I would describe Nations sound: Extremely clean and technical guitar, Soaring vocals and harmony, HUGE double kick drums and bass, and a super slick metal pop production that seals it together. This album is an absolute A+ in my opinion!! \n\n\nBRILLIANT 11*/10.F*cking f*cking brilliant.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb2bd3210f9e646c1a76e4b2d628459607ef014c","amp;dn":"NATION+-+Without+Remorse+%7B1997%7D+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb2bd3210f9e646c1a76e4b2d628459607ef014c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,43,211,33,15,158,100,108,26,118,228,178,214,40,69,150,7,239,1,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
