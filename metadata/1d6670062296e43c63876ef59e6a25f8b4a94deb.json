Now consigned to being a child wanderer, Yohan is        \n    sent off to work on a faraway farm providing cheap labor. Yohan          \n    embarks on a long, rugged journey filled with danger, loneliness and     \n    feelings of abandonment. Along the way, he meets up with two other       \n    child wanderers, 8 year-old Anna and her younger brother. Together       \n    with other child wanderers and led by the menacing boy Aslak, the        \n    group makes its way on foot through the countryside with Yohan           \n    finally arriving at the farm where he is told to work. He becomes a      \n    shepherd boy, protecting the farmer's livestock from wolves and          \n    grizzly bears. His boss, Nome, is a harsh disciplinarian and a tough     \n    man to please. Following his heart and with good intentions, Yohan       \n    makes decisions that are misunderstood by local adults and are           \n    sabotaged by other envious children. Unjustly accused, he is punished    \n    and beaten by Nome. Events only get worse, with wild animals             \n    attacking Nome's herd on Yohan's watch and Yohan's discovery that his    \n    friend Anna and her brother have been beaten at a neighboring farm.      \n    Using his resourcefulness and ingenuity, a battered Yohan sets out to    \n    help his friend Anna and her brother escape from the farm owners.        \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
