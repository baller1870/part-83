Well normally imagines audio is well synced but by zapping trough i noticed a couple of oose scenes starting from -300 up to +500ms. Which results in effects or words coming to early or too late. And i am not talking about dark scenes. All the light scenes have sync issues which is very noticable, especially when they are within one sentence. So it took me 2 hours and 21 cuts to make it sync throughout the movie. all major effects and words should be nearly lipsync now.\n\nThx Hive\n\ncredit CM8 &amp; Hive &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\nBIG BIG BIG GREETZ &amp; THANKS:\nALL members &amp; STAFFS of PIRATEBAY, EXTRATORRENT, KINGDOM, IPTORRENTS, DEMONOID &amp; AHASHARE :)\nKaOsUSC, Motley Crue, InFeCtiouS, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana, BlueLady, UniversalAbsurdity, mc68, TheFalcon007, pardeep333, X, DR67, DiNGiE, xclusive666, pro2kon, EMUworld, wrath, oziman, rubak1, BigPerm1828, skynetcentral, IZON, bluepeas, Dibya9999, Treezluv2draw, pitic, FASAMOO, W1CK3D1NT3Z, GRIND3R, extremezone, MonsterTV, BLaZE, SAFCuk009, Fabreezy, MXMG, Hellb0y, iwanttobelieveinaj, velvetfog, mustaphanaru &amp; many more :)\nALL the awesome people who are SHARING (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY, even the CRITICIZERS )\n***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****\n\nSCREENSHOTS\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/3811/hp3m.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/3811/hp3m.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/7648/hp4b.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/7648/hp4b.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4629/hp5k.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4629/hp5k.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/7016/hp6.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/img210/7016/hp6.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3244/hp1c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/3244/hp1c.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/3128/hp2s.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img694.imageshack.us/img694/3128/hp2s.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDON'T THANK US...HELP SOMEONE IN NEED :)\n\nMAY YOU &amp; YOUR LOVED ONES ALWAYS BE BLESSED WITH LIGHT, LOVE, JOY, PEACE, GOOD HEALTH &amp; ABUNDANCE :)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926084/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46da008621dd8a6be9f0063867fd0e70ef616875","amp;dn":"Harry.Potter.a.t.d.Hallows.2010.TS.XViD.AC3.HQ.Hive-CM8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46da008621dd8a6be9f0063867fd0e70ef616875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,218,0,134,33,221,138,107,233,240,6,56,103,253,14,112,239,97,104,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
