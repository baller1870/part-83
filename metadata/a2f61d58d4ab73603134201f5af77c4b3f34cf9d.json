I made this video for myself since I like this particular performance (mostly because hot chicks playing guitars are awesome lol), but I thought I'd upload it in case anyone else wanted a copy and didn't want to edit the video themselves.  Credit of course goes to VTV for the original torrent, I couldn't live without that guy's uploads.  Enjoy! \n\n-jackalope77\n\n\nFormat: *.avi (xvid)\n\nResolution: 624x352\n\nScreen:\nhttp://bayimg.com/GAbFMaadd","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f61d58d4ab73603134201f5af77c4b3f34cf9d","amp;dn":"Cee-Lo+Green+-+Forget+You+on+The+Colbert+Report+-+2010+11+09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f61d58d4ab73603134201f5af77c4b3f34cf9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,246,29,88,212,171,115,96,49,52,32,31,90,247,124,75,63,52,207,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
