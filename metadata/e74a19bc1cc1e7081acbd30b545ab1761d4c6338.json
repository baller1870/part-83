This is not freeware and does require a purchased, genuine\nlicense to play online.\n\nUSB Edition Goal:\nThis is an updated version of the Cracked HaloCE released a few years back. The \noriginal author cracked it, then made it portable. He then used UHARC to \ncompress into an 85mb executable. The executable was blue and named 'HaloCE.exe' \nwith a happy face. \n\nHalo enthusiasts will know exactly what im referring to. Big props to the\nauthor, as this version has been used, recycled, re-labled throughout the \nyears. Just shows the mastery of his/her work. One of the greatest all-time\nclassic Warez. Just take a look around on the web, and you'll still see it \nfloating around.\n\nUpgrades:\n1. I encapsulated everything, to make it stealth, and work from any location/\ndrive. The original version only worked if you put it in 'C://Halo Custom \nEdition'.\n2. I also extended the portability to work on USB/Portable Media devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e74a19bc1cc1e7081acbd30b545ab1761d4c6338","amp;dn":"Halo+Custom+Edition+-+USB+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e74a19bc1cc1e7081acbd30b545ab1761d4c6338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,74,25,188,28,193,231,8,26,203,211,11,84,90,177,118,29,76,99,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
