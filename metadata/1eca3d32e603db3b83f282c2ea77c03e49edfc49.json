Young New York artist Lauren suffers from \nhorrifying night terrors and struggles to cope with everyday life.\n\nJohn has been plagued by restlessness and sleep-deprivation which \nhas strained his relationship with wife Cindy, whom he hasn't shared \na bed with for five years.\nAs medical experts set out to determine the underlying cause of this \nperplexing disorder, the terrifying reality intensifies as we observe \nfirst-hand those who are completely consumed by it.\nNew item\n\n\n\n__ W4F is looking for __\n. 100mbit+ affil sites (archives a plus)\n.
