Sivaji is her stepson. But Parvati showers equal affection on both of them and this is not liked by Ashok, who is her real son. They are one of the families living on the coastals of Srilanka. One day, this village is forced to evacuate and Sivaji is separated from the family. He ends up in a different boat and lands in Vizag port. He is brought up in the port itself. But his search for his mother never ceases. In that process he comes across Neelu (Shriya). Here, the port is dominated by some goons and naturally Prabhas is an aggressive guy. But he is always controlled by his well wishers. One day, he reacts aggressively and this makes him Chatrapathi. RAS Bihari (Pradeep Rawat) comes down to Vizag in the hunt for Sivaji since Sivaji kills one of his brothers. Also, Ashok lands in the same place. Realizing that Sivaji is his brother, he joins hands with the bad guys. The story is then of Chatrapati's who is searching for his mother and has a bunch of bad guys including his brother on his back while the entire port looks up to him.\n\n\n File info\n\nFile size                        : 701 MiB\nWidth                            : 688 pixels\nHeight                           : 288 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\n\nAudio Format                      : AAC\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\n\nRipper  :Reaper@TamilCreation\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a148453a91a372cbbbd7df4219841dd7394e0c6a","amp;dn":"Chatrapathi+1cd+%285.1+Audio%29+x264+ESubs+-+Reaper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a148453a91a372cbbbd7df4219841dd7394e0c6a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,72,69,58,145,163,114,203,187,215,223,66,25,132,29,215,57,78,12,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
