A full moon hangs in the night sky and lightning streaks across dark storm clouds. Sarah Tyler (Isabella Calthorpe) returns to her troubled family home in the isolated countryside, for a much put-off visit. \nAs the storm rages on, Sarah, along with her family and friends shore up for the night, cut off from the outside world. But something emerges from the driving rain and darkness. \nSomething that holds a dark secret so devastating that, in one night, it could wipe out the entire family. Trapped, Sarah, along with her brothers and friends must use their heads as well as their physical strength to survive not only the thing that is hunting them down one by one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but their own entrapment as the besieged group turns in on itself. Can they survive the horror \nwhich is stalking them? Can they survive for 13 hours?
