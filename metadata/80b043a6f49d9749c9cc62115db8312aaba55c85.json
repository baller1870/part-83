He's not quite sure what he's going to do, except that he knows he wants a holiday. He decides to visit Tiburon Mendez, a powerful but shady Mexican businessman who he once flew to Alaska for a hunting trip. Arriving at the Mendez mansion in Mexico, he is immediately surprised by the beauty and youth of Mendez' wife Miryea. Their attraction to each other is undeniable, but Cochran is aware that Mendez is a powerful, vindictive, and very possessive man who does not tolerate betrayal.\n\n\nNOTE: One of my top 10 movies. Watched gazillion times.\n\nIMDB rating is evidence how lunatics hate nice things (they are not just TPB &quot;special&quot;)\n\nIPOD ITOUCH NOKIA-N97 compatible\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80b043a6f49d9749c9cc62115db8312aaba55c85","amp;dn":"Revenge.1990.DirCut.BluRay.360p.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80b043a6f49d9749c9cc62115db8312aaba55c85","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,176,67,166,244,157,151,73,201,204,98,17,93,184,49,42,171,165,92,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
