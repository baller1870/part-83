The song, co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno, originally appeared as a rough mix on the soundtrack to the film Showgirls and was subsequently remade for Earthling.\n\nA Taxi Driver-influenced music video was produced for the &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans (V1)&quot; remix, starring David Bowie and Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor. Directed by Dom and Nic, it features Bowie being stalked through New York City by Jonny, a hostile American, played by Reznor. As Bowie continues to be harassed and becomes more and more paranoid, he witnesses (or imagines he witnesses) random acts of violence perpetrated by citizens on one another ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but their hands are empty, as if holding invisible guns. The video ends with Bowie ducking behind a taxi while Reznor fires an imaginary assault rifle that inflicts severe damage on a vehicle. Bowie awakens later, only to witness Reznor carrying a crucifix in a parade reminiscent of Day of the Dead celebrations or the movie Something Wicked This Way Comes. The music video premiered on MTV Live, and later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination in 1998 for Best Male Video.\n\n&quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot; originally appeared as a rough mix on the soundtrack to the film Showgirls (in which the chorus is &quot;I'm afraid of the animals&quot; instead of the later &quot;I'm afraid of Americans&quot;) and was subsequently remade for Earthling. This version and two of the Nine Inch Nails remixes were released on the bonus disc of the Digibook Expanded Edition of Earthling in 2004. The song is sampled for a remix of Company Flow's &quot;Patriotism&quot; when El-P performs it.\n\nA CD single for &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot; was released in the United States. The single did not include the album version of the song; instead, it featured remixes of the track performed by Bowie's former tourmates, Nine Inch Nails, and drum and bass artist Photek. The (V1) mix became more popular than the original version, largely in part of the accompanying video, leading to its appearance on the retrospective Best of Bowie.\n\nEarthling is an album by David Bowie released in February 1997 via BMG. The album showcases an electronica-influenced sound partly inspired by the Industrial culture of the 1990s.\n\nThough not a major commercial success, the album scored a number of positive reviews and scored a minor hit with a Trent Reznor remix of &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot;. In the 1998 Grammy awards Earthling was nominated for Best Alternative Music Performance and the song Dead Man Walking was nominated for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. The album featured elements not common to dance electronica, such as live acoustic and electric guitar, jazzy live piano, and song structures more common to pop-rock than techno. The album performed better than its highly experimental predecessor, Outside, reaching number 6 in the UK charts and number 39 in the US.\n\nBowie's enthusiasm for remixing reached its peak when this album was released and the numerous singles from it were also issued to clubs, as well as online: three versions of &quot;Telling Lies&quot; were released on Bowie's official website months prior to the album's release, constituting the first ever downloadable single by a major artist. &quot;Little Wonder&quot; was the album's biggest hit, reaching number 14 in the UK. Three more singles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, and &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ did not fare so well, although the latter did remain in the U.S. charts for 16 weeks, peaking at number 66.\n\nThe music videos for Earthling were elaborate. Artist and director Floria Sigismondi directed the short films for &quot;Little Wonder&quot; and &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;, while Dom and Nic directed &quot;I'm Afraid of Americans&quot;, the latter being nominated for an MTV Video Music Award. A video was also made for &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;, composed largely of concert footage.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40cb104a27128bad97a216796975680b4257ce47","amp;dn":"David+Bowie+-+I%5C%27m+Afraid+Of+Americans+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40cb104a27128bad97a216796975680b4257ce47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,203,16,74,39,18,139,173,151,162,22,121,105,117,104,11,66,87,206,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
