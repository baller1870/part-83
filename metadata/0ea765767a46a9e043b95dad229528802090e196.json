LightSpeed's functionality is designed to support two principal objectives of today's game developers:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Rapid iterationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½change the art, entities, levels, and behaviors and see the effect in your game without recompiling or restarting. This minimizes the need for game restarts and reduces development delays.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Rapid prototyping and productionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½quickly move game content into a playable form, enabling you to evaluate technology and gameplay mechanics and assess the look and feel of levels and assets, and build on that work throughout the production cycle.\n\nAimed to empower innovation, LightSpeed gives developers the tools to quickly realize ideas and be free to iterate throughout the development process.
