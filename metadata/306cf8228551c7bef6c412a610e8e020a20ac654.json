Now, after several years of ups and downs, their debut album finally sees the light of day!\nThe album offers a fine collection of well-crafted synthpop songs that certainly have its own signature sound. The duo delivers compelling melodies and energetic rhythms combined with lush synthesizer arrangements, smooth vocal harmonies and soft, melancholy moods. It is sure to appeal both to fans of classic synthpop and to the fans of more club-friendly synth music.\nFor fans of Camouflage, De/vision, Depeche Mode, etc. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://synthematik.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://synthematik.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:306cf8228551c7bef6c412a610e8e020a20ac654","amp;dn":"RU.ARE+-+RU.ARE+%282010%29+Synthpop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"306cf8228551c7bef6c412a610e8e020a20ac654","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,108,248,34,133,81,199,190,246,196,18,166,16,232,224,32,162,10,198,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
