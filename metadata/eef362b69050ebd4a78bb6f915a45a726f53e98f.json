A few have marveled at the ability to raise and lower terrain via devices in the game, others knocked it for looking too much like Too Human/Gears of War/Dark Sector/Halo, a few have laughed out loud as they watched the driving portions of the title, and some have said it looked kind of fun.\n\nWhen you pick up your controller, you'll be set in the super-suit of Jet Brody, a member of the Atlantic Alliance's armed forces. See, in Fracture, the year is 2161 and everything's gone to hell. Climate change led to the Midwest flooding, and the east and west just got more and more distant with a sea in between them. The east -- the Atlantic Alliance -- began leaning on technology to better their world, while the west -- the Republic of Pacifica -- began tinkering with genetic modification as a way to mold their futures. When the game opens with Jet flying to the Pacifican home base in San Francisco, the president has just outlawed drastic genetic modification. Seems after the announcement of the federal ban, the leader of the Pacifican resistance General Nathan Sheridan began gearing up to take down the Alliance. It's up to Jet to infiltrate Sheridan's base, figure out what's going on, and take out the threat.
