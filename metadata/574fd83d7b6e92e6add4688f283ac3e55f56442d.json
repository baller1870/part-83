This examination        \n    allows for an understanding of how the city - though the most well       \n    served by mass transit in the United Streets - has slowly                \n    relinquished what was a rich, multi-dimensional conception of the        \n    street as public space to a mindset that prioritizes the rapid           \n    movement of cars and trucks over all other functions. Central to the     \n    story is a comparison of New York to what is experienced in London,      \n    Paris and Copenhagen. Interviews and footage shot in these cities        \n    showcase how limiting automobile use in recent years has improved air    \n    quality, minimized noise pollution and enriched commercial,              \n    recreational and community interaction. London's congestion pricing      \n    scheme, Paris' BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) and Copenhagen's bicycle and      \n    pedestrian infrastructure are all examined in depth. New York City,      \n    though to many the most vibrant and dynamic city on Earth, still has     \n    lessons to learn from Old Europe.                                        \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
