Tarpley says that the dollar as the world reserve currency is toast and that it is set to be replaced by a synthetic imperialist global currency called the Bancor. Tarpley warns that the IMF dictatorship is now in the final stages of asset stripping the United States.\n\nTarpley goes on to discuss how the Obama administration and its geopolitical guru Zbigniew Brzezinski are keen to manipulate a war between Iran and Russia or Iran and China, by engineering fake color revolutions which will then install parties hostile to the two Communist states.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b81c9452c65db4ed7e1b86aefab554092ce3123a","amp;dn":"Alex+Jones+interviews+Webster+Tarpley+%28October+2010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b81c9452c65db4ed7e1b86aefab554092ce3123a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,28,148,82,198,93,180,237,126,27,134,174,250,181,84,9,44,227,18,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
