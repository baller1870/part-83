Written by vocalist Eddie Vedder, &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; was released through digital music stores on March 14, 2006 as the first single from the band's eighth studio album, Pearl Jam (2006). The song topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart, where it spent a total of three weeks at number one.\n\n&quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; was written by vocalist Eddie Vedder. The song features a raw sound closer to the band's earlier material. On the song's intensity, Vedder said, &quot;The times...the times kind of demand a little bit of intensity.&quot;\n\nThe lyrics for &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; depict anger against the war in Iraq, and criticize the US government in a subtle manner. Vedder has said that &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot; was written largely about Pat Tillman.\n\nVedder on the song:\n\n    It's about him and a bunch of the guys who didn't get as much coverageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the guys who barely got a paragraph instead of ten pages...The thing about Tillman was, he got ten pages but they were all lies. His family is being blocked by our government from finding out what happened...Where are the leaders that are going to represent a galvanized view on what to do next?...Democracy might have a chance at working if people educate themselves on these issues and make their opinions known.\n\nPearl Jam is the eighth studio album by the American alternative rock band Pearl Jam and its debut and only release for J Records (it was also their last album for what was then called Sony BMG, having previously been signed to J's sister label Epic Records for over a decade). Released on May 2, 2006, it was the band's first full-length studio release in almost four years, the longest gap between Pearl Jam's studio albums to date. Following its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour, Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album. The music on the record was proclaimed as a return to the band's roots.\n\nPearl Jam debuted at number two on the Billboard charts. Pearl Jam was well-received critically, and eventually outsold the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s previous release, Riot Act (2002). The band supported the album with a full-scale tour in 2006. The album has been certified gold by the RIAA in the United States.\n\nPearl Jam is an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band's line-up has included Eddie Vedder (lead vocals, guitar), Jeff Ament (bass guitar), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), and Mike McCready (lead guitar). The band's current drummer is Matt Cameron, also of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998.\n\nFormed after the demise of Ament and Gossard's previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam was criticized early on as being a corporate cash-in on the alternative rock explosion. However, over the course of the band's career its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos and engaging in a much-publicised boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame.&quot;\n\nSince its inception, the band has sold over thirty million records in the U.S., and an estimated sixty million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Allmusic refers to Pearl Jam as &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the '90s.&quot;\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07284ba49388f3760c3ad86832ea072e820ff562","amp;dn":"Pearl+Jam+-+World+Wide+Suicide+%28Live%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07284ba49388f3760c3ad86832ea072e820ff562","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,40,75,164,147,136,243,118,12,58,216,104,50,234,7,46,130,15,245,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
