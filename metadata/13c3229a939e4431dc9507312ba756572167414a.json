Ever\nwished that monsters did at least enough damage to let\nyou use your final limit break once in a while? Got\ndisappointed when the final boss died after one or two\nturns? Ever wished Final Fantasy VII was a bit more...\nepic? \n\nIn this version of Final Fantasy VII you will need every\ninch of fury in the limit bar, you will need the most\npowerful protective spells the game has to offer and you\nwill need to call forth your most devastating summons -\nnot because they look cool, but just to stay alive. \n\nI've tried to stay as close to the original game as\npossible, only increasing difficulty and balancing out a\nfew things. Dialogue is completely untouched. \n\nGemini's spirit bug fix and ARMs FF7 Damage Break (9999\nDamage Cap Remover) has also been included.\n\n\n---=== Main features ===---\n\nPlayer characters:\n\n* Player characters have much less HP.\n\n* You now start with a few more items and Enemy Lure and\nEnemy Away materia in your inventory. Initial materia of\nsome characters have also been changed. \n\n* Stealing items is generally easier and more rewarding,\nespecially in the first part of the game.\n\n* Cloud now requires slightly more XP to level up to\nreduce the level gap between him and other party members\non higher levels. \n\n\nMonsters:\n\n* All monsters have increased stats, hp and mp. \n\n* You can no longer morph monsters into source-items. \n\n* Emerald Weapon is immune to gravity.\n\n* Movers are now less of an ap gold mine and Magic Pot\nwill now only give you gold when you feed it elexirs.\n\n* Some bosses have been rebalanced and most bosses are\nnow immune to slow, stop and darkness.\n\n* Some monsters in the crater can no longer be\nmanipulated, such as Dark Dragon, however you can now\nobtain the enemy skill Dragon Force from Blue Dragon.\n\n* Some monsters such as Master Tornberry, Stinger and\nVlakorados have had their hp and/or immunities changed. \n\n* You will no longer win any items from CMD. Grand Horn.\n\n\nEquipment:\n\n* Some weapons and armors have been rebalanced, e.g.\nweapons/armors without materia slots/growth. \n\n* Ultimate weapons no longer have any special super\ndamage formula which makes them give 10.000+ in damage,\nbut is still of course the best weapon for each\ncharacter and now even have materia growth. \n\n* Ribbons protect against *all* status effects which\nmeans you can't use haste, barriers, reflect or regen\ntogether with a ribbon. \n\n* Tetra elemental now halve elemental damage. \n\n\nMateria:\n\n* Some spells have been rebalanced, most enemy skills\nrequire more mp to use.\n\n* White Wind removes *all* status effects (effect same\nas ribbon.)\n\n* Some materia requires more ap to level up.\n\n* HP/MP Plus materia have had it's effect reduced.\n\n* Knights of the Round is still the most powerful and\npraiseworthy spell of the game, but you will now have\nto pay for what you get. \n\n* Instant death spells is more expensive and will be\nless effective in the crater.\n\n\n---=== Version History ===---\n\n- v5 -\n* Complete remake.\n\n- v6 -\n* Reduced Cloud's XP penalty. \n* Fixed Yuffie's HP/MP. \n* Balanced strength, magic, HP and battle spoils of\nsome bosses and monsters in Midgar. \n\n- v7 -\n* Overall difficulty reduced.\n* Balanced stats of some monsters and bosses.\n\n\n---=== Tools used ===---\n\nI would like to thank the makers of these great tools:\n\nWallMarket\nBy: NFITC1\nWeb: http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=7928.0\n\nHojo\nBy: Squall78\nWeb: http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=7186.0\n\nEnemy Manipulator\nBy: Dr. Dimension\nWeb: N/A\n\nFF7 Scene.Bin Explorer\nBy: Mav \nWeb: N/A\n\nSceneEdit\nBy: Mav\nWeb: N/A\n\nARMs FF7 Damage Break PSX\nBy: Unknown (presumably ARM)\nWeb: N/A\n\nPPF-O-MATIC\nBy: zweifeild, Paradox, H2o\nWeb: N/A\n\nSpirit bug fix\nBy: Gemini\nWeb: http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/501/\n\n\n\n~ Enjoy ~","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c3229a939e4431dc9507312ba756572167414a","amp;dn":"Final+Fantasy+VII+HardType+v7+PSX+NTSC-U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c3229a939e4431dc9507312ba756572167414a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,195,34,154,147,158,68,49,220,149,7,49,43,167,86,87,33,103,65,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
