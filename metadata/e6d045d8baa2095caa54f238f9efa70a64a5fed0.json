This NOVA special investigates this question and looks at the dozen years from 1933-1945, the time that Germany took an &quot;idea&quot; and transformed it into a huge and intricate supersonic missile. The V-2 rocket went from &quot;futuristic fantasy&quot; to &quot;military reality&quot; becoming the most advanced and devastating weapon of its time. HITLER'S SECRET WEAPON features rare test-shot footage, exclusive interviews with the fathers of modern rocketry, Werner Von Braun and General Walter Dornberger, and displays the awesome destructive power of the V-2 after its assaults on London and Antwerp. Produced by Francis Gladstone and Patrick Griffin. Written by Francis Gladstone. Original music by Tom Phillips.\n\n\tI can't find this one anywhere for downloading, so here's my original NOVA VHS, first broadcast in 1977. This is a good quality video copy and quite watchable. Please enjoy.  ;-)  This is an MPG4 H264 ACC NTSC format file - good quality and smaller file size, hopefully for quick downloading.\n\nDuration: 0:58:49\nData Size: 691.73 MB\nBit Rate: 1.64 Mbps\n\nVideo Track:\nH.264, 720 ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€ 540, 29.97 fps, 1.39 Mbps\n\nAudio Track:\nMPEG-4 Audio stereo, 48 kHz, 256 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6d045d8baa2095caa54f238f9efa70a64a5fed0","amp;dn":"NOVA%3A+Hitler%5C%27s+Secret+Weapon+%281977+VHSrip+H264+AAC+NTSC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6d045d8baa2095caa54f238f9efa70a64a5fed0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,208,69,216,186,162,9,92,170,84,242,56,249,239,167,10,100,165,254,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
