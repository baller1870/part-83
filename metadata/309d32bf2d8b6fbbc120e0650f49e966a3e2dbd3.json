Accompanied by some 250 business executives, the President's visit to India is part of a 10-day tour of Asia to boost U.S. exports. Meanwhile a number of groups are protesting Obama's visit to India, including some Left political parties, survivors of the 1984 deadly Bhopal disaster, and the families of cotton farmers who committed suicide, partly as a result of U.S. agricultural subsidies.\n\n\n- Hundreds of Survivors of Bhopal Disaster Protest Obama India Visit\n\nA group of 400 survivors of the Bhopal disaster have been protesting Obama's visit to India. The 1984 Bhopal industrial gas disaster left an estimated 15,000 people dead. The company, Union Carbide, is now a subsidiary of Dow Chemical. Dow has faced calls to clean up the contaminated site, increase compensation for victims, and fund studies to assess damages to the environment and public health. India has also demanded the extradition of former Union Carbide CEO Warren Anderson, who fled India shortly after his arrest in the disaster's aftermath.\n\n\n- The Case of David Headley: Pakistani-American DEA Informant at Center of 2008 Mumbai Attacks\n\nMany in India were disappointed that President Obama made no public mention of a central figure in the 2008 attacks on Mumbai: a Pakistani-American man named David Coleman Headley who was also a former informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Indian authorities have raised questions about why the United States overlooked repeated warnings about Headley's terrorist activities and point to his connections to both American law enforcement as well as Pakistani intelligence officials.\n\n\n- Acclaimed Indian Author Arundhati Roy on Obama's Wars, Poverty and the Resistance Struggle of India's Maoist Rebels\n\nMaoist rebels in India called for a strike Monday to protest President Obama's visit. The Indian media reports Maoists blew up a new school building and killed four persons in the eastern Indian states of Orissa and Bihar. We speak with author and essayist Arundhati Roy about the struggle of the Maoist rebels in India and her assessment of President Obama.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:309d32bf2d8b6fbbc120e0650f49e966a3e2dbd3","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+08+nov+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"309d32bf2d8b6fbbc120e0650f49e966a3e2dbd3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,157,50,191,45,139,111,187,193,32,224,101,15,73,233,102,163,226,219,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
