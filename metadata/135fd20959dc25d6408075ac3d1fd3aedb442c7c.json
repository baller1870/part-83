The show combined the residual energy of Halloween with a tropical feel that could only have happened in South Florida in November. Amidst swaying palms and soft breezes, the band played a deeply experimental show. They were joined by percussionist Karl Perazzo (Santana), whose contribution helped extend and build upon the magic of Halloween, adding polyrhythms that explored new space within Phish\\'s music. Allman Brothers Band drummer, Butch Trucks, furthur upped the percussion coefficient by sitting in on drums for the Encore.\n\nOften cited as a fan favorite, the epicenter of the show was a pairing of Crosseyed And Painless &gt; Run Like An Antelope. Coral Sky showcases the thrilling genesis of a more rhythmic, textured style of group improvisation and conveys the band and crowd\\'s shared excitement about the breakthrough. This 2-DVD set features more than 2 1/2 hours of footage with 5.1 Dolby Surround or optional PCM Stereo sound audio, mixed from multi-track masters.\n\nDisc One\n1. Ya Mar\n2. Julius\n3. Fee\n4.
