Do you like industrial music?  Are you an avid fan of rantradio but don't have time to record it yourself? \n\nFear not! \n\nThis torrent is ~29.7GB of industrial music, ripped straight from http://www.rantradio.com in ONE SINGLE mp3 file!  Might be some duplicates but compressing didn't seem to help much so probably not.\n\nWhat was rantradio/industrial music like back in 2010?  Now you know!  I have no idea how long this is, or even if it'll play in typical mp3 playing software.  Use it pressure-test your audio playing/editing software!\n\nI'm actually still recording onto this file and may eventually come out with a 60GB or 120GB version of this torrent.  But as it stands, we'll see if there's interest in this massive amount of music.\n\nMid novembre 2010 to decembre 12th, 2010 at 2210 saskatchewan time.
