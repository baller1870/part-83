She tells her story of a close encounter incident at Nome, Alaska in October 2000.\n\nIn August 2000, Abbey's husband, Will Jammeson, is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley (Mia McKenna Bruce) and Ronnie (Raphael Coleman). Dr. Abel Campos (Elias Koteas), a physician from Anchorage, encourages Abbey to take some time off but she refuses, stating that WillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s research must be continued.\n\nAbbey returns to Nome to tape hypnotherapy sessions with three different patients, all of whom have the same experience: every night they have each seen a white owl at their window staring at them. Abbey puts a patient named Tommy (Corey Johnson) under hypnosis, who then begins screaming and spasms erratically. After Abbey awakens him, she asks Tommy what he saw but he refuses to answer and leaves. Later that night, Tommy holds his family at gunpoint, demanding to speak to Abbey. After a brief conversation with her, he screams &quot;Zimabu Eter!&quot;, demanding to know what it is, then kills his family and himself. The local Sheriff, August (Will Patton), suspects that AbbeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hypnosis is to blame.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b4411b523940257b6892c6db316dc7cea220ab4","amp;dn":"the+Fourth+Kind+DVDRIP+%7EPINKHONEY0269%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b4411b523940257b6892c6db316dc7cea220ab4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,68,17,181,35,148,2,87,182,137,44,109,179,22,220,124,234,34,10,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
