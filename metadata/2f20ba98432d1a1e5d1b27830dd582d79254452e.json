Wrong! What Hoops really wants to do is write and illustrate a \n\nlove story. To help him find his way, his friend George invites Hoops to come with \n\nhim and his sister to spend the summer on Nantucket. The friends Crazy Summer \n\nbegins when they pickup Cassandra on the way--she's being chased by a motorcycle \n\ngang. From here on in, it only gets crazier.
