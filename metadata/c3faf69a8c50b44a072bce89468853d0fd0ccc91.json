The harmonies and shared lead vocals \n\noffer a complementary contrast between Ronstadt's purity \n\nof tone and Savoy's more piquant expressiveness. The \n\narrangements turn folk songs into art songs, drawing as \n\nmuch upon chamber strings as Cajun fiddle and accordion. \n\nThere's an exquisite beauty to the vocals, but the real \n\nsurprise is how well the album holds together, given a \n\nrange of material that extends from Cajun songs in French \n\npatois to stellar material from Julie Miller (&quot;I Can't Get \n\nOver You,&quot; with husband Buddy Miller on guitar) and \n\nRichard Thompson (&quot;King of Bohemia,&quot; &quot;Burns' Supper&quot;) \n\nto a disarming revival of the Left Banke's 1960s hit &quot;Walk \n\nAway Renee.&quot; Among other highlights, &quot;Go Away from My \n\nWindow&quot; provides a showcase for the upper register of \n\nRonstadt's soprano, and Savoy's lead vocals on Bill \n\nMonroe's &quot;The One I Love Is Gone&quot; bring out the blues in \n\nbluegrass. --Don McLeese \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp  \n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/27/the-zozo-sisters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/27/the-zozo-sisters/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3faf69a8c50b44a072bce89468853d0fd0ccc91","amp;dn":"The+Zozo+Sisters...Adieu+False+Heart%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3faf69a8c50b44a072bce89468853d0fd0ccc91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,250,246,154,140,80,180,74,7,43,206,137,70,136,83,208,253,12,204,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
