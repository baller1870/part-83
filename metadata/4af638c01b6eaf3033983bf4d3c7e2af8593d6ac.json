Years later, back on her feet and fed up with grey skies and concrete, she gave up her flat in London for a wood and tin shack in the Australian bush where she recorded and released her debut album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Stranger PlaceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ to critical acclaim by the Australian media. \n\nCombining ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwisdom, hard-hitting social commentary and beautiful poetryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (Tsunami Magazine), 'Stranger Place' was ABC Radio ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Album of the WeekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ across 2 states. The first track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The Real WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ secured her an invitation to perform at the 2005 Singer-Songwriter Festival at The Borderline in London, where she opened for David BowieÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s renowned bassist Gail Ann Dorsey. She made such an impression that promoter Barry Everitt booked her for 2 more gigs on the spot and after she returned to Australia, he wrote on the venue website: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is always a place for her on our stage. Her superb songs have grown on all who have seen her and we need her back soon.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nFollowing a nationwide UK tour in May 2006, Emily returned to Australia to record a new album 'Keep Walking' with bass player Christian Dunham and drummer Shane Nesic. Putting her cello playing to good use, she borrowed a violin, viola and cello and recorded all the parts herself to create her own string ensemble. The result was an album that has been described as &quot;music and lyrics of an artist that goes leaps and bounds beyond... a decades and genre spanning piece of work that should be admired as a whole as much as for each individual song&quot; (IndepenDisc, New York). The title track ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Keep WalkingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is currently on ABC Radio across Australia. \n\nEmily remains passionate about both Bach and Bob Marley, combining her love of classical music with a passion for beats, basslines and acoustic guitar. But it is her words that have the most profound effect on her listeners. In a recent interview with British newspaper The Independent, she said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWhat I want to do with my songs is to give people the same feeling you get when you go and look at the horizon above the sea and you get a sense of silence and space and possibilityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Her signature song 'Falling on my Feet', written in a north London hospital, is a prime example. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/emily-maguire/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/11/emily-maguire/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af638c01b6eaf3033983bf4d3c7e2af8593d6ac","amp;dn":"Emily+Maguire...Keep+Walking%282007%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af638c01b6eaf3033983bf4d3c7e2af8593d6ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,246,56,192,27,110,175,48,51,152,59,244,211,199,226,175,133,147,214,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
