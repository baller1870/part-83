It is provided for free by TWiT (http://twit.tv) and is hosted by Leo Laporte (of TWiT) and Steve Gibson (of grc.com). \n\nWebsite: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://twit.tv/sn&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://twit.tv/sn&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTopics include:\n\n- Cracking WEP (Explains why it's possible, not just how to use tools.)\n- ARP Poisoning (Why it's possible, not just how to use tools.)\n- Cryptography (Internals of the AES cipher, public key crypto, etc..)\n- Building a sonic beam weapon AKA &quot;Portable Dog Killer&quot;\n- Rootkits\n- Exploits (Buffer overflow, SQLi, XSS, etc.)\n- Detailed explanation of VPNs, SSL/TLS, DNS, etc..\n- A really cool voting machine hack\n- Worms/Viruses/Trojans\n- LZ compression algorithm\n- Boyer &amp; Moore buffer search algorithm\n- How computers work (in detail).\n- Bluetooth\n- Vitamin D\n- And MUCH more...\n\nIn my oppinion, SecurityNow is MUCH better than all the other security netcasts because it emphasizes understanding the technology behind the security issues being discussed. It doesn't teach you how to use hacking tools like a script kiddie, it teaches you everything you would need to know to MAKE those tools yourself.\n\nFor episode titles, descriptions, show notes, and transcripts, visit:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\thttp://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\thttp://www.grc.com/securitynow.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d99e6ceffbf4d5dcc76b89f2d825d9b029c265bd","amp;dn":"SecurityNow.Podcast.1-281","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d99e6ceffbf4d5dcc76b89f2d825d9b029c265bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,158,108,239,251,244,213,220,199,107,137,242,216,37,217,176,41,194,101,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
