Basic instrumentation, guitar, violin, cymbalom, doublebass, percussions, voice, no electronic gadgets or keyboards, simple, but pleasurable indeed. Even &quot;India&quot; is involved. Or the old song from Southern Serbia, re-arranged, but with maestro Boban Markovic on trumpet. Expression is everything, they know how to slow down or lift you up. While Vince had his own bands for ages or collaborated with many local musicians (currently he is a member of Boris Kovac's LaDaABa Orchest), some of his band members performed with Lajko Felix and some also with their own bands. Region of Serbia where they are living, called Vojvodina is part of Panonia, where influences are so mixed, and them, being Gypsies can make something creative out of that. Olah Vince, the Gypsy activist, is not satisfied to live one life, he is helping others, trying to establish Gypsy radio in Novi Sad, but he cannot live without playing music. Are we not all Gypsies? Listen to this music, dance, shout be Gypsy, be free.\n\n\nMusicians\n\nOlah Vince - guitar, violin &amp; vocal, Karlo Varga - violin, Ramiz Toplica - percussion, Michael Kurina - Cymbalon, Ferenc Kurina - double bas, Boban Markovic - trumpet (title 9)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.asphalt-tango.de/records/ews/artist.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.asphalt-tango.de/records/ews/artist.html&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9edf4de3b4c4922460a7b69c558f418970ddab0","amp;dn":"Earth-Wheel-Sky-Band+-+Waltz+Rromano","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9edf4de3b4c4922460a7b69c558f418970ddab0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,237,244,222,59,76,73,34,70,10,123,105,197,88,244,24,151,13,218,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
