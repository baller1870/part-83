Brotherhood is the Manga story completely followed making fans of the comic much happier.\n\n\nLanguage: Japanese 2.0, English 5.1\n\nSubtitles: English \n\nEpisodes 1-32\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c71e02a71bc258dd22d12bf5fc0114f2297a3f1f","amp;dn":"Full+Metal+Alchemist+Brotherhood+%28Dual+Audio+720p%29+Episodes+1+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c71e02a71bc258dd22d12bf5fc0114f2297a3f1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,30,2,167,27,194,88,221,34,209,43,245,252,1,20,242,41,122,63,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
