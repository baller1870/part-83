This is the kind of music I imagine a few generations ago would have easily landed on bestselling Hillbilly charts before some executive in the 40ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s decided the term too degrading (and probably less market-friendly) and changed the name to Country &amp; Western.\n\nNow this music finds its home in the Americana genre, where skilled musicians like Hosking remind us that music that tells tales of peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s lives, with instrumentation and arrangement that also hearken from that heritage, is so wholly satisfying in a world more and more addicted to entranced and irony.\n\nThe slow burners are the real stand outs.  Simple pleasures yearn from the title track as MainesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Dobro and HoodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fiddle envelope you with the sonic equivalent of a down comforter, Montgomery Creek Blues is a dreamy pedal-steel laced tale of drunken revelry that ends in murder and Hiding Place (my hands-down favorite) is a sparkling ode to solitude that betrays a hint of menace from possible pursuer.\n\nPrecious Little, Little Joe and Holier Than Thou are straight up honky-tonkers that shoudl strike shame in the heart of every Music City big label suit.\n\nWith Come Sunrise Hosking gives us a prism that isolates the distinct historic threads of country and folk music and then combines it again\ninto a wholly satisfying and extraordinary body of work.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/21/rita-hosking/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/01/21/rita-hosking/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca45c09c8e6809dc907df6b62b66967c367b1638","amp;dn":"Rita+Hosking...Come+Sunrise%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca45c09c8e6809dc907df6b62b66967c367b1638","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,69,192,156,142,104,9,220,144,125,246,182,43,102,150,124,54,123,22,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
