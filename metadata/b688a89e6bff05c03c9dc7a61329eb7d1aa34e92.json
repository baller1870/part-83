After a\nbooking mishap involving a Christian fundraiser, he decides\nhe's hit rock bottom. Seeking to shake things up, he moves to\nL.A. where his luck changes overnight. Thanks less to his inept\nmanager than to a wild case of mistaken identity, he falls\nbackwards into a string of packed gigs, a record deal and even\nthe promise of love. But he who lives by the whimsy of show\nbusiness dies by it, and reality hits him like a fist in the\nface: an innocent miscommunication over a bagel brands him a\nneo-Nazi in the world of tabloid journalism. Luckily, somewhere\nbetween rock bottom and nowhere lies the perfect terrain for\nhis dark and hilarious songs. Hailed by comedy icon Sarah\nSilverman as &quot;the best movie about comedy I've seen so far,\n&quot; this hilarious and evocative film is &quot;totally primed for a\nfervent cult following.&quot;\n\n\n\nScreens\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/3144/sampleavisnapshot000620.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img600.imageshack.us/img600/3144/sampleavisnapshot000620.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/7286/sampleavisnapshot002320.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/7286/sampleavisnapshot002320.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/5808/sampleavisnapshot025020.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/5808/sampleavisnapshot025020.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b688a89e6bff05c03c9dc7a61329eb7d1aa34e92","amp;dn":"Punching+the+Clown+2009+DVDRip+XviD-ViP3R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b688a89e6bff05c03c9dc7a61329eb7d1aa34e92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,136,168,158,107,255,5,192,60,157,199,166,19,41,235,125,26,163,78,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
