If human morality is an evolutionary adaptation and if neuroscientists can identify specific brain circuitry governing moral judgment, can scientists determine what is, in fact, right and wrong? The panelists were psychologist Steven Pinker, author Sam Harris, philosopher Patricia Churchland, physicist Lawrence Krauss, philosopher Simon Blackburn, bioethicist Peter Singer and The Science Network's Roger Bingham.\n\nRecorded live at the Arizona State University Gammage auditorium.\n\n&quot;The Great Debate&quot; was sponsored by the ASU Origins Project in collaboration with the ASU Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law Center for Law, Science and Innovation; the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge; and The Science Network. \n\n\n\n\n\nI ripped these off youtube because streaming sucks over my connection, if you want to help seed:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nondescriptman#g/c/B347FE6920F4736D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/nondescriptman#g/c/B347FE6920F4736D&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHere's a cool little app for downloading flash movies:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://xviservicethief.sourceforge.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://xviservicethief.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6217bb81856c97b98f6278f23611cc5b78ccac4","amp;dn":"The+Great+Debate+-+Can+Science+Tell+us+Right+From+Wrong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6217bb81856c97b98f6278f23611cc5b78ccac4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,33,123,184,24,86,201,123,152,246,39,143,35,97,28,197,183,140,202,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
