However, any true fan of Chip and the Steamroller knows that this CD is the soundtrack to a televised ice skating show that aired on NBC back in December of 1998 and will be airing again December 2000 on NBC (It may even become a Christmas tradition). The music, for the most part, is from previous Christmas recordings, but it has certainly not lost it's magic! The story, narrated by Chip and Olivia Newton-John, is a bit unusual, but makes more sense when watching the ice skating performance.\n\nAllmusic Review:\nEven though their music is easily enjoyable by listeners of all ages, Christmas Angel: A Family Story is the first album Mannheim Steamroller has made that is directly targeted at family audiences. Not that the music sounds that different -- it's still the Fresh Aire we have all grown to love -- but the music tells a story that should delight children and parents alike. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3da425d38ab7f71fc98a351cd4d7146032c1a984","amp;dn":"Mannheim+Steamroller+-+Christmas+Angel%3A+A+Family+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3da425d38ab7f71fc98a351cd4d7146032c1a984","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,164,37,211,138,183,247,31,201,138,53,28,212,215,20,96,50,193,169,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
