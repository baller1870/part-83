Even if the band's music is best used as loud background music for the band's visual extravaganza, the band did have a few jewels down the front of their bulging trousers. On You Wanted the Best, You Got the Best!, they let them hang down to the ground, preventing the need to buy a full Kiss album ever again. &quot;Firehouse,&quot; &quot;Calling Dr. Love,&quot; &quot;I Stole Your Love,&quot; and of course &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; shine through, and for the deluded die-hards, there are three previously unreleased live tracks and an interview with Jay Leno sure to raise the room temperature a few degrees. \n\nby Jon Wiederhorn \n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Room Service.wma                                           \n02 - Two Timer.wma                                              \n03 - Let Me Know.wma                                            \n04 - Rock Bottom.wma                                            \n05 - Parasite.wma                                               \n06 - Firehouse.wma                                              \n07 - I Stole Your Love.wma                                      \n08 - Calling Dr. Love.wma                                       \n09 - Take Me.wma                                                \n10 - Shout It Out Loud.wma                                      \n11 - Beth.wma                                                   \n12 - Rock And Roll All Nite.wma                                 \n13 - Kiss Tells All.wma \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d4a2ec1e54c17e54f2e8a2b95a3f116abf08213","amp;dn":"KISS+-+You+Wanted+The+Best%2C+You+Got+The+Best%21%21+%281996%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d4a2ec1e54c17e54f2e8a2b95a3f116abf08213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,74,46,193,229,76,23,229,79,46,138,43,149,163,241,22,171,240,130,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
