Rock band from Bergen/Norway (1988-1994). This is their legendary first release. Originally a cassette copied and sold in a limited number.\nRecorded on an inexpensive 4-track portastudio, so it\\'s not hi-fi. But the energy and the quality of the songs remains quite enjoyable.\nHope you like it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a72f054e5fcfce7bfff209150c32dbbc8a238ce","amp;dn":"Pompel+%26+the+Pilts+-+Kjellerteipen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a72f054e5fcfce7bfff209150c32dbbc8a238ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,114,240,84,229,252,252,231,191,255,32,145,80,195,45,187,200,162,56,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
