Born To Sing, their 1990 debut album dropped four #1 R&amp;B singles, &quot;Hold On&quot;, &quot;Lies&quot;, &quot;You Don't Have To Worry&quot; and &quot;Don't Go&quot;. Born To Sing achieved platinum status The act later released a six - song remix album titled &quot;Remix To Sing&quot; in 1991 before releasing one of the best selling albums of 1992. That album is, &quot;Funky Divas&quot;. &quot;Funky Divas&quot; went directly to #1 and would later be certified 4x platinum and garnered 5 Grammy nominations.\n\nThe &quot;Funky Divas&quot; dropped the #1 singles, &quot;My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It),&quot; &quot;Giving Him Something He Can Feel,&quot; and the gold &quot;Free Your Mind.&quot; &quot;My Lovin'...&quot; and &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; were two of the most played videos of '92. It was at the 1992 MTV Music Awards when En Vogue premiered their hit rock song &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; and won 6 MTV Video Awards. In '93, they were honoured with the &quot;Soul Train Entertainer Of The Year&quot; Award and an American Music Award for &quot;Best Soul Album of the Year&quot;. &quot;Runaway Love&quot; their next single from an EP of the same name won an American Music Award and their collaboration with Salt 'N Peppa on the next single, &quot;Whatta Man&quot;, more than ever made En Vogue a household word. \n\nBy 1995, En Vogue came back with the smash hit &quot;Don't Let Go (Love)&quot;. With a warm reception to &quot;Don't Let Go (Love)&quot;, En Vogue released their next album &quot;EV3&quot; and within a few short months &quot;EV3&quot; went platinum. After the release of three singles from &quot;EV3&quot;, including the powerful ballad &quot;Too Gone, Too Long&quot;, the group once again decided to take a short hiatus. This break would temporarily be interrupted by their contribution &quot;No Fool No More&quot;, the title track to the 1999 film; &quot;Why Do Fools Fall In Love&quot;. It wasn't long before May 2000 when En Vogue came back on the scene with a new single &quot;Riddle&quot;. &quot;Riddle&quot; lead to the release of En Vogue's fourth full-length album, aptly titled &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. \n\nEn Vogue has always garnered acclaim for their style and grace and have achieved global status as one of our time's preeminent female R&amp;B/Pop female ensembles.
