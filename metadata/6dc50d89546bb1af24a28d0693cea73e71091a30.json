Now, at last, the label has had a change of heart, releasing this solo album by Fay Hield, the partner of folk star Jon Boden and best known for her role with the four-piece a cappella group the Witches of Elswick. All of which raises a lot of expectations, but this is a good, rather than exceptional, set. Hield is a fine technical singer, though the best songs here are those featuring the subtle accompaniment of Boden on fiddle, concertina and guitar, and his Bellowhead colleague Sam Sweeney adding viola, fiddle or the traditional Swedish nyckelharpa. The songs vary from the cheerful Mad Family or Grey Goose and Gander, where Hield sounds at her most relaxed, through to the narrative ballads The Banks of the Nile or The Shepherd's Daughter, which she sings well but they don't yet sound like great story songs she has made her own.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/18/fay-hield/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/18/fay-hield/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6dc50d89546bb1af24a28d0693cea73e71091a30","amp;dn":"Fay+Hield...Looking+Glass%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6dc50d89546bb1af24a28d0693cea73e71091a30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,197,13,137,84,107,177,175,36,162,141,6,147,206,167,62,113,9,26,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
