The film is the eighth in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line released by Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation. It was released on July 27, 2010. The film stars Bruce Greenwood as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Jensen Ackles as Red Hood/Jason Todd, and John DiMaggio as the Joker. The screenplay was written by Judd Winick, who also wrote the \\&quot;Under the Hood\\&quot; run in the monthly Batman comic.\n\n\n\nRa\\'s al Ghul hires the Joker to help him with his latest terrorist scheme, but soon regrets it when the Clown Prince of Crime kidnaps Jason Todd, the second Robin. In a warehouse in Sarajevo, Bosnia, the Joker beats Jason with a crowbar, ultimately leaving him half-dead on the warehouse floor. Jason tries to get out, but the Joker put a lock on the door. He then sees a bomb ticking in the warehouse. Batman arrives too late, and Jason is killed in the explosion.\n\nFive years later, in Gotham City, the vigilante/crime lord Red Hood has assembled a meeting with the city\\'s top-earning thugs and dealers. The Red Hood announces his takeover of the drug trade and tells them to give him 40 percent of their earnings in return for protection from Batman and Black Mask, but he also tells them not sell their drugs to children. As a warning, he tosses them a bag containing the severed heads of all their lieutenants.\n\nAt the docks, Batman chases some thugs in a moving truck and crashes it into a wall. He tries to interrogate them until the box that was in their truck opens and reveals Amazo, a powerful android with the ability to copy the abilities of every metahuman it encounters. Nightwing (Dick Grayson), who was once the first Robin, arrives on the scene to help him. After a short fight, the robot is defeated and Batman interrogates the three thugs at the location and finds out they are working for the Red Hood. The Red Hood then kills the thugs with a sniper rifle. Batman chases the Red Hood, who leads him to the Ace Chemical Plant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the site of the first Red Hood\\'s transformation into the Joker. The current Red Hood rigs an explosion in the plant and escapes.\n\nLater in the Batcave, Nightwing appears, having returned after he learned of the Red Hood. Batman tells Nightwing that since the Red Hood began his reign of terror, drug trafficking has gone up, but crime has gone down. Batman and Nightwing proceed to Arkham Asylum to interrogate the Joker about the Red Hood. The Joker taunts Batman by reminding him of Jason\\'s death, tempting Batman to kill him, then denies any involvement with his successor.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected by Brandon Vietti\nProduced by Bruce Timm\nBobbi Page\nAlan Burnett\nSam Register\nBenjamin Melniker\nMichael Uslan\nWritten by Judd Winick\nBased on Batman by\nBob Kane and Bill Finger\nStarring Bruce Greenwood\nNeil Patrick Harris\nJensen Ackles\nJohn DiMaggio\nJason Isaacs\nWade Williams\nMusic by Christopher Drake\nStudio Warner Bros.
