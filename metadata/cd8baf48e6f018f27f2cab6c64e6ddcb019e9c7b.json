Everything Changes\n2. Day One\n\nThis Torrent originally had 2 discs in 1 Zip file but the files were not separated into individual folders for extracting. I had to determine which file belonged with each disc \n\nby comparing the time on each double file. It wasn't difficult to do, for me but might be for some which is not a reflection on anyone, it is simply a fact. \nI have included the the &quot;Read Me&quot; from the person who was kind enough to prepare, which can be very time consuming, and share these DVD's. I looked for the \n\noriginal creator's nick or username and found &quot;Tribbleuser&quot; which I hope is correct. \n\nI want to make it clear that I am not the person who made these DVDs and I am not the person who distributed them. I want to thank Tribbleuser for their time, effort, \n\nkindness and generosity which made it possible for us to enjoy these DVD's.  \n\nTorrent Description by Tribbleuser For - Torchwood - 2006 - S1P1 [DVD (PAL) TRBLE]\n\nFor anyone not aware, I am uploading the whole of Doctor Who, on DVD, in order. I started with William Hartnell in June 2007, and reached the end of 'Classic' Who \njust before Christmas 2009. As soon as one disc is fully seeded I do the next one. To the credit of the downloaders, most of the (almost 200) torrents I have uploaded over the last 2 and a half years are still available and still seeded! Since roughly the beginning of Tom Baker they have been labeled 'TRBLE' to aid searching. Up until the last series of Sylvester McCoy they were all uploaded to Mininova. With the demise of that institution I am now uploading to TorrentZap, most of my torrents have found their way onto here as well.\n\nAlong the way I have also been uploading any Who related extras I have. I'm going to continue that, along with all of the official spin off series' which have come along with the 'new' Who.\n\nThe first season of Torchwood comes in 3 double disc sets. This is Part 1, both discs. \n\nMedia info:\nDuration - Unknown\nBit Rate - 4020 kbps\nStream #0.0[0x1e0] - Video - MPEG2 Video, YUV420p, 720 x 576 [PAR 64:45 DAR 16:9], 9800 kbps, 25.00 tb(r)\nStream #0.1[0x80] - Audio - AC3, 48000 KHz, Stereo, 192 kbps\n\nCategory - TV Show - TV Program - Torchwood\n\nOriginal Torrent Name - Torchwood - 2006 - S1P1 [DVD (PAL) TRBLE]\nOriginal Torrent Format - 1 Zip File With 31 Files \nOriginal Torrent Size - 8.72 GB\nOriginal Primary Tracker - http://tracker.openbittorrent.com:80/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd8baf48e6f018f27f2cab6c64e6ddcb019e9c7b","amp;dn":"Torchwood%2CTRBLE%2CTV+Series%2CDVD%2CSeason+1%2CDisc+1%2CEpisode+1%2CEpisode+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd8baf48e6f018f27f2cab6c64e6ddcb019e9c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,139,175,72,230,240,24,242,127,44,171,108,100,230,221,203,1,158,156,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
