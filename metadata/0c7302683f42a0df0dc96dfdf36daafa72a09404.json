Mitchell debuted as Tung Twista in 1992 with Runnin' Off at da Mouth and dropped &quot;Tung&quot; from his stage name in 1996. He once held the title of fastest rapper in the world: according to the Guinness World Records in 1992, being able to pronounce 11.2 syllables per second. In 1997, after appearing on Do or Die's hit &quot;Po Pimp&quot;, Twista was signed to Atlantic Records and debuted under that label with Adrenaline Rush and formed the group Speedknot Mobstaz in 1998.
