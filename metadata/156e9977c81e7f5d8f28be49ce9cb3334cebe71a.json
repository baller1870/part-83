Over 250 Canadians aboard were part of the international effort to curb and deter piracy in the waters off the Horn of Africa. Global Maritimes was there.\n\nEmbedded onboard the Fredericton, were Global Maritimes Fredericton bureau reporter Allison Melanson and cameraman Kevin Godwin. \n\nUsing material shot during their time on board, Global Maritimes produced this one hour documentary, a look at the ship, the mission, and the group of men and women of the Fredericton.\n\nThis documentary aired on Global TV on Nov. 13, 2010.
