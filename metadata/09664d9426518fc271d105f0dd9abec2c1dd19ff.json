I had to sync each file up, but it was well worth it!)\n\n\n\nThis file has much better audio that I re-muxed so thank you so much to the original uploader and enjoy this better audio version available here now!!! I had been looking for this for about 10 years now!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!\n\nIf you listen closely, you can hear the VHS &quot;rumbling&quot; in the original. This file contains none of that, and is much &quot;cleaner&quot;. Good job to me, lol!\n\n\nVideo: XviD 29.97 fps 696x472 Progressive\n\nAudio: DD2.0 AC3 192 Kbps @ 44.1 KHz\n\nDuration: 59:08.892\n\n\n\nHigh quality multiple screen shot image: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2356/jewelwoodstock99vhsvide.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/2356/jewelwoodstock99vhsvide.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The original file (and this file too) is out of original aspect ratio. I recommend one of two things:\n\n1) Re-encode the video to 4:3 aspect ratio.\n\n2) Use Media Player Classic Home Cinema to set the aspect ratio to 4:3 (Video frame | Override Aspect Ratio | 4:3) while watching.\n\n\nMerry Christmas, enjoy and please seed!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09664d9426518fc271d105f0dd9abec2c1dd19ff","amp;dn":"Jewel+-+Woodstock+1999+VHS+and+Better+Audio+Source+-TG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09664d9426518fc271d105f0dd9abec2c1dd19ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,102,77,148,38,81,143,194,113,209,5,240,221,154,190,194,193,221,25,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
