Gideon has received a cabinet full of awards, but they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell us anything about his spiritual leanings, or his vital sense of family. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no surprise that an award like the Andrew Hill Award from the Amsterdam Trust points to a major influence from the American free jazz pianist on GideonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s music, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just technique or arrangement that drives his music. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all about telling a story, and the emotions behind that story - and conveying them through a sublime chord progression is a gift Gideon definitely has, as the closing breakdown in the title track neatly demonstrates.\n\nWhether heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in a studio setting with JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© James, or with his 6 piece band, Gideon knows how to tap into the heart strings, pulling intervals and transitions out of the piano like an expert osteopath. Gideon might have written the tunes, but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s his group that breathes life into them every performance. With Rick Rosato (bass) and Flin van Hemmen (drums) powering the rhythm section, Gideon finds himself mediating between them and the twin saxes of Lucas Pino (tenor) and Lars Dietrich (alto). The five of them can turn from powerfully expressive to dextrously lyrical in the space of a turnaround, and generate a charged atmosphere for singer Becca Stevens to thread her absorbing, wordless vocal lines. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s clearly jazz, but in the hands of masters like these, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s definitely content over style.\n\nWhile the album title could lead to any number of long conversations by the bar, about endless cycles and anxieties of the infinite, Gideon takes solace in the fact that weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re part of a wider continuum, a bigger picture. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s good to know thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always something around the corner,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ he says. Perpetual might be Gideon looking to the bigger picture, but he knows how to make the most of the moment too.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bf4f1cb940bba58cc2c15645ebcbefc0e79e21a","amp;dn":"Gideon+van+Gelder-Perpetual+%5B2010%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bf4f1cb940bba58cc2c15645ebcbefc0e79e21a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,244,241,203,148,11,186,88,204,44,21,100,94,188,190,252,14,121,226,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
