The reunited Duran Duran, filmed during a two-night stand at Wembley Arena in 2004, plunges into &quot;(Reach Up for the) Sunrise,&quot; before launching into old favorites like &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Something I Should Know.&quot; LeBon keeps the stage patter to a minimum; it's all about the music. On occasion, the Armani-clad quintet are joined by statuesque singer Sara Brown (&quot;Come Undone,&quot; &quot;Notorious,&quot; &quot;The Reflex,&quot; etc.) and sax man Andy Hamilton (&quot;Union of the Snake,&quot; &quot;Rio&quot;). As expected from a band that came to fame during the height of the video era, film and anime images are projected during certain numbers, such as &quot;The Chauffeur,&quot; &quot;Careless Memories&quot; and &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; (grainy Rhodes-shot images of Liz Hurley rather than scenes from the James Bond outing of the same name). The one selection that doesn't quite fit the 20-song set is 1988's &quot;I Don't Want Your Love.&quot; With Brown's help, they give it their all, but funk-metal isn't really Duran Duran's strong suit (although the song later appears as a 3D bonus feature). The deluxe edition includes a 10-track CD recorded during the same London engagement and a pair of 3D glasses. --Kathleen C.
