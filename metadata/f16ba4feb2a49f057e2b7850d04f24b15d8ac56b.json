Thanks a to a small Canada-based production/distribution company called Cinerio Entertainment, though, many of the episodes are now for sale on a series of single-disc, separately-sold DVDs. Each volume is produced with the utmost care and new interstitials starring the original puppets (and their original voices) -- only made to look a little older for purposes of retrospection -- have been filmed to introduce each new episode. For such a long-forgotten preschool production, that's a pretty exceptional effort and a very nice touch. The DVDs are available only at CinerioEntertainment.com and currently carry a retail price of $14.95 each. The episodes assembled for Volume 3, the subject of this review, make for a particularly strong lot and come highly recommended. A closer look at those episodes is provided below. \n\nVolume 3 episodes:\n  \n\n&quot;To the Dentist&quot; (1989) (15:20) \n\nUpon learning that he's due for a dentist appointment, Iggy becomes gripped by fear. Holly, Jacob, and Gloria decide to stage a mock dentist visit to help ease his fears. \n\n&quot;Migration Party&quot; (1989) (15:17)  \n\nIt's Jacob's turn to host the bird migration party, in which hundreds upon hundreds of birds will stop by the home for refreshments and a rest. Needless to say, Holly is more than a little apprehensive about the arriving guests. \n\n&quot;Jacob's Girlfriends&quot; (1989) (15:16) \n\nJacob juggles different dates in an attempt to find the best dancing partner for an upcoming competition, showing little regard for the girls' feelings. \n\n&quot;Going Bananas&quot; (1988) (15:16) \n\nGloria is torn when she gets invited to a costume party but Jacob, Iggy, and Holly do not. \n\n&quot;Stargazing&quot; (1989) (15:15) \n\nIn an especially mellow episode, the gang gets access to a telescope and go out on the porch for a night of singing and stargazing. \n\n\n***I WILL SEED DURING NIGHTS (GMT-4) AND PART OF DAY!
