Even with all the controls, the program still manages to be simple to operate, especially for those willing to invest the time.\nOur first impressions were not positive since the program's interface looked slightly childish, thanks to command icons that are all various smiley faces. Fortunately, the tutorial videos that pop up immediately prove that this is a serious tool and seriously easy. We smoothly navigated the program's functions that are represented by the previously mentioned smileys, each offering ways to shade, erase blemishes, and even erase features (the tutorial's example shaves a few centimeters from a man's chin in a profile photo). It was a relief to find that all the tools followed the same pattern of adjusting the size and intensity with sliders and by clicking and dragging the changes on the picture. While a little clumsy at first, the tools got easier with a little practice. The best we tested were the tools that subtly erased blemishes because they smoothly blended the skin defects into the healthy flesh. Our favorite feature was its Original button, which let us toggle between the changes and the untouched photo. Overall, each tool was effective and simple to understand, though each required patience in perfecting.\nPhotoinstrument's trial does not let users save their work. While the program looks childish and takes some practice, its results were professional enough that we recommend it.\n\nScreenshot &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/9609/girlb4.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img255.imageshack.us/img255/9609/girlb4.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img262.imageshack.us/img262/3461/girlaft.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img262.imageshack.us/img262/3461/girlaft.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/6827/manb4.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img196.imageshack.us/img196/6827/manb4.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/4592/manaft.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img80.imageshack.us/img80/4592/manaft.gif&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img139.imageshack.us/img139/2646/mixl.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img139.imageshack.us/img139/2646/mixl.gif&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1cfcb91b6fc9bbe0790fe174426f04a1b64ed260","amp;dn":"PhotoInstrument+v3.4+%28Portable%29-kasimji","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1cfcb91b6fc9bbe0790fe174426f04a1b64ed260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,252,185,27,111,201,187,224,121,15,225,116,66,111,4,161,182,78,210,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
