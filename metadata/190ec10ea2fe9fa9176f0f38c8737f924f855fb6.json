They do some songwriting, \nbut their specialty seems to be a balanced mix of very tasty interpretations \nof early classic rock n' roll, ballads, blues, and Jimi Hendrix.\n__________\n\n1 - Just Came Back.\n\n2 - My Future Ex-Wife.\n\n3 - Taxi Driver.\n\n4 - A Thing Called Love.\n\n5 - Brother Doctor, Sister Nurse.\n\n6 - Lucky In Love.\n\n7 - Love Don't Bother Me.\n\n8 - Burning The Church House Down.\n\n9 - Wouldn't Lay My Guitar Down.\n\n10 - Somebody's Leaving Somebody.\n\n11 - Check Up From The Neck Up.\n\n12 - Switchboard Susan.\n\n13 - The Unforgiven.\n__________\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFile size : 10.7 MiB\nDuration : 4mn 41s\nOverall bit rate : 320 Kbps\nAlbum : Open All Hours\nTrack name : Just Came Back\nTrack name/Position : 1\nPerformer : Hamsters\nRecorded date : 2004\nWriting library : LAME3.92\nComment : tag generated with TagScanner\n\nAudio\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nDuration : 4mn 41s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nStream size : 10.7 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : LAME3.92\n__________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:190ec10ea2fe9fa9176f0f38c8737f924f855fb6","amp;dn":"The+Hamsters%282004%29Open+All+Hours%5D%5Bmp3+320kbs%5D%5BICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"190ec10ea2fe9fa9176f0f38c8737f924f855fb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,14,193,14,162,254,159,169,23,111,15,56,200,115,127,146,79,133,95,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
