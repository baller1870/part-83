Director Hajime Tabata noted that the gameplay and plot are intertwined due to an ability called &quot;Overdive,&quot; which is an ability that lets you switch bodies with one of your team members. Using the skill, you can freely control other people. Overdive also allows Aya to dive into the mind of the Twisted causing lethal damage. You can change your currently controlled character in real-time, intermixed with your combat actions.\n\nHideous creatures descend on Manhattan. Ground reports from the squad tasked with containing the pandemonium refer to these life forms as the Twisted. An investigatory team known as the CTI (Counter Twisted Investigation) is formed within the year.\n\nAya is the main focus of this game. Due to her special powers, she still has the body of a woman in her 20s, although in terms of age she should actually be 39 years old. Motomu Toriyama, the scenario director, feels that it is rare to be able to focus on a woman in her 30s in a game and is taking the opportunity to properly depict the thinking and lifestyle of a cool woman.\n\nJapanese Version [Partial English Bits]\nEnjoy : )","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a199dc19ec9b3a36b563abd8bccb7d34dab8d17","amp;dn":"Parasite+Eve+-+The+3rd+Birthday+JAP+%5BChasmas%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a199dc19ec9b3a36b563abd8bccb7d34dab8d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,25,157,193,158,201,179,163,107,86,58,189,139,204,183,211,77,171,141,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
