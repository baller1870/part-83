The song is the fifth track from Cowboys from Hell, the band's fifth album and second with lead singer Phil Anselmo (though the band considers it their first &quot;true&quot; album, officially ignoring their earlier independent releases as it was their first album with the Groove Metal genre). &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; showcases Anselmo's vocal ability and range, concluding with screaming high notes answered by Dimebag Darrell on guitar in a trade off.\n\nA shorter version of &quot;Cemetery Gates&quot;, without its acoustic beginning, was released into a music video. A shortened, five minute and forty-seven second version without the conclusion was included on the soundtrack of the 1995 film Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight. Pantera's live album, Official Live: 101 Proof, includes a six and a half minute rendition of the song.\n\n&quot;Cemetery Gates&quot; was the second single released by the band off their Cowboys from Hell album. It received a large amount of air-play by rock stations, and has become one of Pantera's most popular songs. It reached #18 on the US Mainstream Rock Tracks. Guitar World magazine readers voted the song's solo the 35th greatest of all-time, which was Dimebag's 2nd highest ranking solo (after &quot;Floods&quot;). The song was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998.\n\nThe lyrics lament the death of a female relative or friend and the prospect of dying or committing suicide and rejoining her in the afterlife. Phil Anselmo stated in an interview in 1991 that this song was written about his good friends that had committed suicide.\n\nAfter Dimebag's death, the song was performed by Dream Theater as a tribute during Gigantour. The band was joined on stage by Russell Allen of Symphony X for the first verse, Burton C. Bell of Fear Factory for the second verse and Dave Mustaine of Megadeth for the ending solo. The song was also covered by Between the Buried and Me on their album The Anatomy Of. Another cover version by Evile appears in the Metal Hammer Tribute to Dimebag Darell album and a re-issue of their Infected Nations album. A cover of the song was also released as downloadable content for Rock Revolution.\n\nCowboys from Hell is Pantera's fifth album and their first Atco Records album, recorded at The Dallas Sound Lab in Irving, TX and released on July 24, 1990. This was their first commercially successful album, exposing the band's groove metal style to mainstream audiences.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3d90f6553d5c638f9a4405a5f9af826401690da","amp;dn":"Pantera+-+Cemetery+Gates+%28Movie+Version%29+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3d90f6553d5c638f9a4405a5f9af826401690da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,217,15,101,83,213,198,56,249,164,64,90,95,154,248,38,64,22,144,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
