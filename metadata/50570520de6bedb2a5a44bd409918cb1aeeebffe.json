Usually - the purpose with .RAR is to make files smaller AND/OR making sure the files contains no download errors. RAR have been used for over 15 years - check out Wikipedia.\n\n* The reason ive decided for .RAR files is to make sure its the Original and Untampered release, and to keep GOA, D2V and ViCH happy.\n\n\n\n* You may also need a Codec Pack for XviD unless you have Windows 7.\n\n\n\n* Airdates / Releasedates of these episodes are between 2010-11-29 and 2010-12-16","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50570520de6bedb2a5a44bd409918cb1aeeebffe","amp;dn":"Paradise.Hotel.S04E29-E40.SWEDISH.XviD+%28with+RARs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50570520de6bedb2a5a44bd409918cb1aeeebffe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,87,5,32,222,107,237,178,165,164,75,212,9,145,140,177,174,238,191,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
