Instead, she enjoys the attentions of its owner, not to mention the full talents of the resort's gourmet chef. Quite accidentally, she stumbles upon the corpse of a young woman who seemingly died of anorexia. The ever-curious Mrs. Pargeter sets out to discover the facts surrounding the suspicious death. Enlisting the help of her dead husband's associates from the underworld, she winds her way through charlatans and impostors and toward a dangerous confrontation. Author Brett's background in radio serves well in his narration of his novel. Richly drawn characters, fine tension, and unbeatable humor are delightfully enriched with his reading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39abd2a429b3034fc2da02e0ef8307f06f2a694e","amp;dn":"Mrs+Pargeter%5C%27s+Pound+of+Flesh+-+Simon+Brett++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39abd2a429b3034fc2da02e0ef8307f06f2a694e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,171,210,164,41,179,3,79,194,218,2,224,239,131,7,240,111,42,105,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
