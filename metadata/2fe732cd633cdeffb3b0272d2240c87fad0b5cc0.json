He also found time to write the album California. \n\nSimplicity is the order of the day and, for the most part, everything centres around Curreri and his acoustic guitar. There are some anomalies, such as the Knopfler tinged guitar licks of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Once Upon A RooftopÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and the gentle cover of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“WildegeesesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which sees him duet with wife Devon Sproule, but on the whole this is one man and his guitar. \n\nCalifornia is a welcoming record and encountering it is perhaps akin to dashing in out of the howling wind and rain and finding a barstool next to a crackling open fire. Highlights are the Dylan-esque ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Here Comes Another Morning,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which rattles along like an old boxcar, and the genuinely arresting ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ReturnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ which tells the tale of a man saved from the crutch of affected artistic despondency by the irresistible lure of love. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/20/paul-curreri/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/20/paul-curreri/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fe732cd633cdeffb3b0272d2240c87fad0b5cc0","amp;dn":"Paul+Curreri...California%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fe732cd633cdeffb3b0272d2240c87fad0b5cc0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,231,50,205,99,60,222,255,179,176,39,45,34,64,200,127,173,11,92,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
