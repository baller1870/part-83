Written and directed by David Lynch, the film stars Bill Pullman, Patricia Arquette, Balthazar Getty and Robert Loggia. Lynch co wrote the screenplay with Barry Gifford, who also wrote the novel that served as the basis for Lynch's Wild at Heart (1990). The film features the last film appearances of Richard Pryor and Jack Nance, as well as the most recent film to date for Robert Blake.\n\nLynch conceived Lost Highway after the critical and commercial disappointment of Twin Peaks Fire Walk With Me (1992), a film adaptation and follow up to the widely successful cult television series Twin Peaks, produced by Lynch. In tradition of most of Lynch's films, Lost Highway has a largely cryptic narrative. Lynch has also declined to offer an explanation of his intentions for the narrative which has seen audiences speculate on what transpires throughout the course of the film's plot.\n\nThe film tells the story of a saxophonist who is accused under strange circumstances of the murder of his beautiful, supposedly unfaithful wife. The film then introduces a completely different story involving a young auto mechanic and his mysterious blonde girlfriend who bears a strong resemblance to the saxophonist's murdered wife. Lost Highway was one of Lynch's most unsuccessful theatrical releases, leaving critics polarized because of its seemingly incoherent narrative and receiving the infamous two thumbs down from Siskel and Ebert. Despite initial negativity, the film has become a cult film and was selected by They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nLost Highway was shot in approximately 84 days; from November 29, 1995 until 22 February 22, 1996, funded with a moderately large budget of $15 million from the French production company StudioCanal. A vast majority of the film was shot in locations throughout California, in Los Angeles, with the desert scenes being filmed in Nevada. Fred and Renee's mansion is a property of Lynch's which he, along with most of the furniture, had designed himself. The interior shots of the Lost Highway Hotel were filmed at the Amargosa Hotel in Death Valley, which is believed to be haunted.\n\nThe first cut of the film ran just over two and a half hours. After a screening with 50 people, Lynch cut out 25 minutes of footage, including an autopsy scene of Renee's corpse.\n\nThe storyline is similar to Ambrose Bierce's story An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge, in which a prisoner is hanged, while imagining escaping and traveling home.\n\nPhilosopher Slavoj Zizek interprets the film's bipartite structure as exploiting the opposition of two horrors, the phantasmatic horror of the nightmarish noir universe of perverse sex, betrayal, and murder, and the (perhaps much more unsettling) despair of our drab, alienated daily life of impotence and distrust.\n\nMedia Info:\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : J:\\Seeding\\Lost Highway (1997)[DVDRip][big_dad_e]\\Lost Highway (1997)[DVDRip][big_dad_e].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.26 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 14mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 340 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                               : 0\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Simple@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : No\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Default (H.263)\nCodec ID                         : DIVX\nCodec ID/Info                    : Project Mayo\nCodec ID/Hint                    : DivX 4\nDuration                         : 2h 14mn\nBit rate                         : 1 199 Kbps\nWidth                            : 720 pixels\nHeight                           : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16:9\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nStandard                         : NTSC\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.145\nStream size                      : 1.13 GiB (89%)\nWriting library                  : avc2.0.11.1110\n\nAudio\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nMode                             : Joint stereo\nMode extension                   : MS Stereo\nCodec ID                         : 55\nCodec ID/Hint                    : MP3\nDuration                         : 2h 14mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 123 MiB (10%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n\nFile Scan:\nMalwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46\nwww.malwarebytes.org\n\nDatabase version: 5063\n\nWindows 5.1.2600 Service Pack 3\nInternet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702\n\n11/6/2010 10:13:15 PM\nmbam-log-2010-11-06 (22-13-15).txt\n\nScan type: Quick scan\nObjects scanned: 7\nTime elapsed: 5 second(s)\n\nMemory Processes Infected: 0\nMemory Modules Infected: 0\nRegistry Keys Infected: 0\nRegistry Values Infected: 0\nRegistry Data Items Infected: 0\nFolders Infected: 0\nFiles Infected: 0\n\nMemory Processes Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nMemory Modules Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Keys Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Values Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nRegistry Data Items Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFolders Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nFiles Infected:\n(No malicious items detected)\n\nWhen using TPB please read these important notes:\n  \n01- Anti-malware apps may warn about keygens, patches, cracks, etc., because of \n    their capabilities, (generating codes, etc.). Sometimes they're added to \n    the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If you don't trust\n    the keygens, patches, cracks, etc., don't use them. \n    \n02- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks, etc., always check first \n    if they can be unpacked. Often some third party added a virus to the \n    original file, repacked it and uploaded it again.\n\n03- Letting anti-malware apps send scan results to their companies can cause\n    keygens, patches, cracks, etc., to be added to their virus-database.\n\n04- Firewalls which are set to automatically determine connections will allow \n    apps &amp; malware!. Avoid this by manually configuring your firewall.\n\n05- Usually (new) torrents with many downloads and seeders in a brief period is\n    suspicious! Torrents with the Skull &amp; Crossbones icon are trusted.\n\n06- Some people use multiple accounts and post fake comments \n    and/or files trying to spread confusion. They seldom seriously\n    comment or have any torrents, or a just a few to look passable.\n\n07- Clicking on unknown links can cause malware to be installed on your machine.\n  \n08- In general often there are more fake and negative comments than reliable and\n    positive comments.\n\n09- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright protected material is \n    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable up-loaders is not.\n\n10- Posting fake and negative comments or fake/infected uploads on TPB can result\n    in getting banned from TPB!\n \n\nFor reporting bad or suspicious torrents:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more of my torrents: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/user/big_dad_e/&lt;/a&gt;  (Secured)\n\nAll torrents scanned with:\nNorton Anti-virus\nMalwarebytes' Anti-malware\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.pirate-party.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nALWAYS SEED &amp; THANKS SEEDERS!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc3d4ef0d68b9f12f54d1fa8070ef62aae1e53b","amp;dn":"Lost+Highway+%281997%29%5BDVDRip%5D%5Bbig_dad_e%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc3d4ef0d68b9f12f54d1fa8070ef62aae1e53b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,195,212,239,13,104,185,241,47,84,209,250,128,112,239,98,170,225,229,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
