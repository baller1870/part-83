They bring back that element of close and personal intimacy and unpredictability to any size stage or venue, transforming it into a spectacle that is impossible to take your eyes off of. They create an environment and atmosphere designed to challenge the audience\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s preconceptions of the traditional live music performance, and they have the effect of both drawing you in and making you feel uncomfortable at the same time.\n\n\n    Nassau Chainsaw continuously exceeds the audiences expectations by treating each live show as a full blown production that could actually be considered performance art. They have been able to accomplish increasingly mind blowing stage productions to perfection since the addition of the DisGraceLanD Demolition Committee. On the surface, an outfit of side show freak oddities that specialize in pyrotechnics and performers who pierce their flesh with shark hooks and then suspend themselves on stage, in fact they are a group of professionally licensed body piercers, artists and riggers that insure all suspensions and piercings are done safely. Nassau Chainsaw DisGraceLanD Demolition Committee also have a licensed EMT on staff at shows to ensure that all bio regulations are strictly adhered to.\n\n\n    Word of mouth and the elements of real blood, high energy, and a great sounding live band have allowed them to develop an impressive fan base that allowed Nassau Chainsaw DisGraceLanD Demolitions Committee to embark on their first east coast tour early 2008.\n\n\n    Audience response has been overwhelmingly positive and the continuing successful performances garnered the attention of renowned Candiria front man Coma who approached the band and offered to produce their first album entitled the Asphalt Chronicles. Sharing deep roots in The New York Hardcore/Metal community, the band received support on the album from some heavy hitters, featuring guest appearances from highly regarded NYHC vocalists such as Tim Williams of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Vision of Disorder\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, Sal of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Sworn Enemy\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, Coma of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Candiria\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, and Mike D of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Carbomb\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; just to name a few.
