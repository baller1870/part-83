Being live, you can hear the crowd, and whoever is hosting throws some occasional crowd-pumping commentary over the tracks. It certainly sounds like one hell of a show, I would have loved to have been there. Most of these tracks are available on teranoid &amp; MC Natsack's other albums, Teranoid Overground Edition, Teranoid Underground Edition, and Teranoid Overground Edition 1.04. As far as a favorite track, that's easy, &quot;Pumpin Rabbit Express - full sizeversion&quot;, 4:35-5:00 is one of the most fun buildups I've ever heard in a track. Download the album, each track stands by itself despite being a live set, and have a good time.\n\n&quot;skip2the...&quot; and &quot;Skip to Skip&quot; are the other highlights.\n\n\n01. terabient #2 - teranoid\n02. ay carumba!!! - teranoid &amp; MC Natsack\n03. skip2the... - Orangehair\n04.
