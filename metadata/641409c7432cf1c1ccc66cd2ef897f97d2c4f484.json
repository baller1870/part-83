LOUD, set\nto arrive on November 16th, has been described by insiders as a return to the\nuptempo dance grooves of her earlier records\n\nSetting the scene for LOUD is the first lead single, &quot;Only Girl (In the World),\nwhich went to radio and clubs September 7th. The uptempo track is produced by\nStargate, the Norwegian team whose career has been intertwined with Rihanna (and\nher fellow Def Jam hitmaker Ne-Yo) since 2006, including &quot;Unfaithful,&quot; Don't\nStop the Music,&quot; &quot;Hate That I Love You&quot; (featuring Ne-Yo), &quot;Take a Bow,&quot; and her\nmost recent #1 global smash, &quot;Rude Boy\n\nEarlier this spring, the RIAA double-platinum &quot;Rude Boy&quot; (the fifth\nmulti-platinum certified song of Rihanna's career) hit #1 on a slew of charts\nincluding Billboard's Hot 100 and Hot 100 Airplay, and MediaBase's Pop, Hot\nDance Radio, Hot Dance Clubs, Rhythm, and Urban charts. With &quot;Rude Boy&quot;'s\nsuccess, Rihanna became the first female artist of the past decade to chart six\n1's on the Hot 100 - and tied Madonna in first place with seven #1's on the Hot\nDance Airplay chart (launched in 2003\n\nPrior to &quot;Rude Boy,&quot; 2009's &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; also made chart history for\nRihanna - as her 12th Billboard Hot 100 career hit, placing her second (after\nBeyonce) among female Hot 100 artists in the decade since 2000. After &quot;Rude\nBoy,&quot; Rihanna was back on the charts as featured artist on Eminem's &quot;Love the\nWay You Lie&quot; - which hit #1 on the Pop Songs Radio Airplay chart, and tied\nRihanna for the most #1's (six) on the chart, with Mariah Carey, Beyonce and\nLady Gaga\n\nLOUD follows-up Rated R (November 2009) and its sequel Rated R: Remixed (May\n2010). Previously, the double-platinum Good Girl Gone Bad (May 2007) contained\nthe Grammy-winning global #1 hit &quot;Umbrella&quot; (featuring Jay-Z), then &quot;Shut Up and\nDrive,&quot; &quot;Hate That I Love You&quot; (featuring Ne-Yo), and &quot;Don't Stop the Music\nThe CDDVD package Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded (January 2009) continued the\nhits with the #1 &quot;Take A Bow,&quot; the #1 &quot;Disturbia&quot; and Top 20 &quot;Rehab.&quot; Good Girl\nGone Bad was the third album release in less than two years by Barbados native\nRihanna, who turned 22 on February 20th. It followed-up 2006's RIAA platinum A\nGirl Like Me, which contained the back-to-back hits, &quot;S.O.S.&quot; and &quot;Unfaithful\nand her RIAA gold debut from 2005, Music Of the Sun, featuring the world-wide\nsmash, &quot;Pon De Replay\n\nEnjoy\n\nInfo\n\nLike it?
