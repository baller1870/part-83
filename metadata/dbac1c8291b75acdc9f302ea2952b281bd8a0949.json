The story begins in the 1990s in Gothenburg with Gonzalez and Elias Araya, who began collaborating when they were 14 years old in the band Renascence. Later joined by Tobias Winterkorn, the trio completely swapped their hardcore rock sound for the gorgeous, haunting folk style we associate with Junip today. Taking the scraps of songs that Gonzalez presented them, the group improvised drawn-out pieces, then re-recorded the best in DIY fashion on 4-track cassettes. The recordings were released in 2000, but the group never managed to piece together a full-length album until now.\n\nAnother five years since the release of the band's Black Refuge EP in 2005, Junip has finally obtained its teenage dream with Fields. Lining its raw but soft sound with haunting melodies, hypnotic psychedelia and Afro-beat inspired rhythms, it's clear that the time it took to piece together the album was well worth it.\n\n\n\n01 - The Full Live Session On World Cafe (December 1 2010)(NPR)(MP3@320)(22min)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2010/12/01/131702886/junip-on-world-cafe?ft=1&amp;f=10001&amp;asid=84d21ad4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2010/12/01/131702886/junip-on-world-cafe?ft=1&amp;f=10001&amp;asid=84d21ad4&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecember 7, 2010\n\nJunip is JosÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez on guitar and vocals, Tobias Winterkorn on keys and effects, and Elias Araya on drums. On its recent visit to the KEXP studios, the Swedish trio was joined by a bassist and a hand percussionist to round out its full yet quiet and dreamy sound.\n\nWhile Junip's recent Fields is its first full-length album ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the band previously released a single and an EP in 2005 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ these childhood friends have actually been working together since 1998. Their career was put on long-term hold when JosÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© GonzÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez's solo career took off. Several solo records and years of touring later, they returned to Junip and the magic was still there. Both the album and the group's live show are beautiful.\n\nGonzÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez's whispery vocals and quiet, intricate guitar work are recognizable from his solo work, but it would be a mistake to think of Junip as Jose GonzÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡lez with a backing band. Each member brings something unique to the overall sound: Winterkorn, for example, drives Junip's sound forward with snaky Moog lines, adding rich ambiance to the songs. Meanwhile, Araya keeps a mellow tempo throughout, while a second percussionist complements the band's sound with shakers, bongos and tapping of a small glass jar that sounded so perfect, it sent shivers up my spine.\n\n\n02. - The Full Live Session From KEXP (December 7 2010)(NPR)(MP3@320)(20min19sec)\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2010/12/07/131668837/junip-revived-by-sound&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.npr.org/2010/12/07/131668837/junip-revived-by-sound&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore info:\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.junip.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.junip.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junip&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/mb/mb100913junip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/mb/mb100913junip&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/search/?query=junip&amp;search_type=standard&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://pitchfork.com/search/?query=junip&amp;search_type=standard&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!!\nTHANKS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbac1c8291b75acdc9f302ea2952b281bd8a0949","amp;dn":"Junip+-+2+NPR+Live+Radio+Shows+December+2010+%28Indie+Folk%29%28Jose+G","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbac1c8291b75acdc9f302ea2952b281bd8a0949","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,172,28,130,145,183,90,205,201,243,2,234,41,82,178,129,189,138,9,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
