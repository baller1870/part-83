For the first time in the Total War series each troop is an individual, garbed with the rich heraldic colours and glinting arms and armour of the period.\n\nOn the battlefield theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll survey their surroundings for threats and incoming opponents and react accordingly. When engaged theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll string together a series of devastating moves as Medieval 2ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new combat animation brings the conflict to life like never before. Total War has never been so ferocious or realistic.\n\nThe Medieval 2 grand campaign will hand you the reins of one of an emerging faction as you set about sweeping throughout Europe, conquering all before you. Expand your borders and develop your lands for wealth and prosperity by building cities or swell your army by constructing vast castles to protect your land and keep your rivals quaking with fear.\n\n\nMedieval II: Total WarÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Kingdoms \n\nFeature 4 brand new campaigns, including an opportunity to more fully explore The New World that was unlocked toward the end of Medieval II. In the Americas campaign, players will be able to retrace the steps of HernÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n CortÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s in 1519, as he seeks to explore and conquer The New World. Players can earn the support of Spain and explore the mystery and riches of the New World, or take control of the Aztec or Native American factions and call on the Gods and the bravery of vast armies to see off this new threat.\n\nThree other campaigns will offer more detailed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œmagnifying glassÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ campaigns within Great Britain, Northern Europe and the Holy Land, with many more regions than were originally shown in Medieval II. Featuring 13 new playable factions and over 150 new units, Kingdoms will allow players to control thousands of men on a single battlefield and lead them into conflict with new hero characters such as Richard The Lionheart and Saladin, each armed with new, powerful battlefield abilities. In addition, players will use moated forts to garrison vast armies or seize control of key strategic points and explore new technology trees, governed by religion and prestige.\n\nPlayers can experience a bloody clash between pagans and Christians in the Northern European Teutonic Wars, or take control of one of 5 factions in the Britannia campaign when England faces war on 4 fronts as once conquered lands rise up against them. Kingdoms will also include a new expanded Crusades campaign, where players renew their fight for control of the Holy Lands, with new factions, devastating new units (such as the terrifying Greek Flame Thrower), legendary heroes and powerful holy relics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:102a24ca06349a798f4a8afa62c93d93fb6bce01","amp;dn":"Medieval+II+Total+War+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"102a24ca06349a798f4a8afa62c93d93fb6bce01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,42,36,202,6,52,154,121,143,74,138,250,98,201,61,147,251,107,206,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
