AVI's have become obsolete. \n\nHowever, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete. This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads. THANKS!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI took the VIDEO TS file of the DVD and ripped a H.264 MP4 file. The file has a suffix of .m4v as it was ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 so it can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. It can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.\n\nA note about the audio:\n\nThe videos indicate a separate AC3 channel with Dolby Digital 5.1 when you &quot;Get Info&quot; using iTunes. For a better explanation of this go to:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/SurroundSoundGuide&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://trac.handbrake.fr/wiki/SurroundSoundGuide&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe second and third paragraphs apply to these rips. But as I understand it, all the suffixes must remain .m4v.\n\nAll I really know is I get 5.1 surround sound when I play on my 1st Gen Apple TV\n===========================================================================\n\nSting - Brand New Day Tour (Universal Amphitheater 2000) \n\nSynopsis\nThis stop on Sting's Brand New Day Tour tour finds the singer/songwriter/actor not only playing songs made popular from his solo career and days with his previous band The Police, but he also performs the album of the same name in its entirety. Sting's vast musical range is displayed here, as he performs reggae with &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot;, gets a little jazzy on &quot;Moon Over Bourbon Street&quot; and contemplative on &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;. This 18-song concert video provides a prime opportunity to get a good overview of Sting's dazzling musical career, as well as a taste of what the man is like in performance. ~ Dan Macintosh, Rovi\n\nChapter Listing\n\n1.\t A Thousand Years [6:08]\n2.\t If You Love Somebody (Set Them Free) [4:17]\n3.\t After The Rain Has Fallen [5:26]\n4.\t We'll Be Together [2:54]\n5.\t Perfect Love...Gone Wrong [6:21]\n6.\t Seven Days [5:00]\n7.\t Fill Her Up [5:33]\n8.\t Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic [4:19]\n9.\t Ghost Story [4:51]\n10.\t Moon Over Bourbon Street [4:54]\n11.\t Englishman In New York City [5:26]\n12.\t Brand New Day [5:33]\n13.\t Tomorrow We'll See [5:50]\n14.\t Desert Rose [4:29]\n15.\t Every Breath You Take [4:18]\n16.\t Lithium Sunset [4:27]\n17.\t Message In A Bottle [2:50]\n18.\t Fragile [4:02]\n19.\t Credits [1:06]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bfde928842176004a2ec4d1c56a61d7610c181f","amp;dn":"Sting+-+Brand+New+Day+Tour++%282000%29+H.264+.m4v%2F.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bfde928842176004a2ec4d1c56a61d7610c181f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,253,233,40,132,33,118,0,74,46,196,209,197,106,97,215,97,12,24,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
