We get some background on George Lucas' start in the business and then continue with the making of Star Wars (1977), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). The visual/special effects and financial problems are explained as well as casting, editing, scoring and releasing the films with tons of archival footage and interviews with plenty of cast &amp; crew members. Written by Rhyl Donnelly\n\nThe most comprehensive look at the making of the Star Wars trilogy ever produced. This 2 and a half hour special examines the early concepts, the deals, the productions hell and then the eventual success of George Lucas' space opera. With commentaries from the cast and crew and stories about how a little movie that was looked upon as an impending box office disaster and became a cultural phenomenon. Then Lucas discusses how this tug-of-war with the Hollywood system forced him to turn his back on them and make The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) completely on his own.
