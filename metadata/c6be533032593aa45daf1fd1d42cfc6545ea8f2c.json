When NASCAR fans talk about great races the conversation always seems to get around to the 1998 Daytona 500. NASCAR was celebrating its 50th season; Daytona was running its 40th 5000, and Dale Earnhardt was looking to end a 59-race losing streak and 20 years of frustration in The Great American Race. In the end it would be Earnhardt holding off Bobby Labonte and Jeremy Mayfield for his greatest victory. Greatest Races Ever and Motorsports Images and Archives are proud to offer the complete network broadcast of the 1998 Daytona 500 on DVD for the first time.
