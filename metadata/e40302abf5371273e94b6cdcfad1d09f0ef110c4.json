ESET Smart Security 4 keeps your PC safe with advanced proactive detection that blocks most known and undiscovered threats hours or days faster than other Internet security technologies.\n\nKey Features\n\nSmarter Scanner ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Threats don't always enter in ways you expect. ESET Smart Security inspects SSL-encrypted communication channels like HTTPS and POP3S, and intelligently scans compressed files to find threats that other products miss. ESET's Smart Optimization feature makes file scanning faster than ever.\n\nTime-saving Firewall ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ New Learning Mode saves time by automatically creating firewall rules by observing how end users use the network, while offering advanced firewall modes for power users. Pair customized firewall profiles with trusted network zones and have appropriate firewall rules applied automatically based on detected network presence.*\n\nTrusted Zone Authentication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Identify trusted network zones by network configurations (a configurable combination of host/DNS/DHCP server IP address, wireless SSID, connection profile, etc) or securely authenticate into a network using ESET Authentication Server.*\n\nUpgraded Antispam ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ESET Smart Security now takes care of annoying spam with a smaller, faster, and even more effective spam filter.\n\nRemovable Media Security ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Threats can enter your PC from removable media such as USB thumb drives. For self-running media, ESET Smart Security scans autorun.inf and associated files when the medium is inserted, in addition to scanning any file on any removable device when it is accessed, or during a full-scan of the media.\n\nSystem Tools ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ESET SysInspector and ESET SysRescue simplify diagnosing and cleaning of infected systems by allowing deep scans of system processes to find hidden threats, and creating bootable rescue CD/DVD or USB drives to help you repair an infected computer.\n\nSelf Defense ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ESET Smart Security has built-in technology to prevent malicious software from corrupting or disabling it, so you can rest assured your system is always protected.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e40302abf5371273e94b6cdcfad1d09f0ef110c4","amp;dn":"ESET+Smart+Security+Nederlands+%26+English+%2B+Tnod+1.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e40302abf5371273e94b6cdcfad1d09f0ef110c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,3,2,171,245,55,18,115,233,75,108,220,250,209,208,159,14,241,16,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
