So much so that he takes a job as caretaker of the cemetery in which his brother is buried. Charlie has a special lasting bond with his brother though, as he can see him. Charlie meets up with his brother (Sam) each night to play catch and talk. Then, a girl comes into Charlie's life and he must choose between keeping a promise he made to Sam, or going after the girl he loves.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6402fa1c610ddfbaaa1d0004355a3d07dd7f8ed","amp;dn":"Charlie+St.+Cloud+2010+-+dvdrip+-+arabic+subs+hard+coded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6402fa1c610ddfbaaa1d0004355a3d07dd7f8ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,64,47,161,198,16,221,251,170,161,208,0,67,85,163,208,125,215,248,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
