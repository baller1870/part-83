To my knowledge this is the only Half-SBS 3D rip of the movie.  My upload bandwidth is quite limited so PLEASE seed your max at least until there are a few seeders. I will seed this for a month and try and keep a constant schedule (can't help if my computer crashes while I am asleep or away.  Also I am excited about the quality of the rip, as it looks crystal clear.  Thank you.  Screen shots coming soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c05209a3c7e0a9b0a0a07bf0e3c63908b5bd239","amp;dn":"Resident+Evil+Afterlife+3D+Half-SBS+1080p+3DRIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c05209a3c7e0a9b0a0a07bf0e3c63908b5bd239","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,5,32,154,60,126,10,155,10,10,7,191,14,60,99,144,139,91,210,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
