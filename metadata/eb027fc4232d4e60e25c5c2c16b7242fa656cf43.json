If you\\'re like most people, it\\'s just a resort. A place to run for hapiness, or perhaps a place to hide from sorrow. It\\'s a way of expressing anger, emotion, joy and love. It\\'s a genuine feeling to let your best friend listen to your favorite song and them bob their head. Music could set the soul on fire, send it burning high and proud then leave it tumbling to the ground. Music could mean anything.\n\nAnd then there\\'s Farewell Unknown.\n\nMusic in Farewell Unknown\\'s eyes all started in August of 2002. To vocalist Joel Rabara (Soft Spoken) and Drew (Flite 26), who first met in high school while living large, starting a band seemed like the cool thing to do (you all know how that goes). Heaven was playing in front of the buddies while they hit the G.B. After landing a bassist, they recorded their first demo, entitled Youth Forgotten, in the fall of 2002, just a few months after establishing their false sense of fulfillment. The 4 song demo, which was everything short of a platinum record, turned heads from all over town. Shortly after, they appeared in the Sacramento Bee just before starting the gigs.\n\nMusic means friends\n\nThey recorded their first EP in the summer of 2003, entitled \\&quot;Tomorrow\\'s Promises\\&quot;. After adding guitarist Will Swan (Here Lies Ink, Translucent, Kut-Chord) to the lineup, and with it saying goodbye to Joel\\'s blink 182 influ-input, their sound was almost complete. By then they had attracted the voices of several record labels, but they felt their sound was not yet complete.\n\nMusic means a ticket to stardom\n\nIn the fall of 2003, they released yet another 3 song demo, including their popular hit \\&quot;Right Where You Fall\\&quot;, which was featured on the Tragedy Productions Compliation CD. The cd was later reviewed by Acclaimedpunk.com, and Farewell Unknown\\'s \\&quot;Right Where You Fall\\&quot; was one of three standout tracks on the compilation. By then, Farewell Unknown was slowly taking steps to the right direction of the sound they would eventually become. They blended screaming dual solo guitar riffs with unique drum beats to keep your heart pumping, all topped off with layered vocals streaming lyrics that can only stick to your head, whipped cream and a cherry on top.\n\nMusic means sacrifice\n\nBy the summer of 2004, they had played with bands such as The Reunion Show (Victory Records), Somehow Hollow (Victory Records), Fairview (Side Cho Records), The Prize Fight (ECA Records), Five Minute Ride (720 Records), No Avail, Plans For Revenge, Chances Are, Gooser, and numerous other great bands. It was just before guitarist Alvaro Alcaca and Bassist/Vocalist Eric Lodge (Freeride) completed the lineup that Farewell Unknown was picked up by Less Avenged Records out of the bustling music city of Seattle, Washington. They are set to release their highly anticipated sophomore ep, titled \\&quot;The Fourty Day Fakeout\\&quot; in late August, while touring the western United States.\n\nMusic means success\n\nThey are blessed with the greatest fans anywhere in the country--Sacramento local music fans. They recieve neverending support by the Less Avenged Records staff, the 720 Records staff, Ken at the Underground Cafe, and the staff over at Tragedy Clothing and Productions as well as all the bands in Sacramento. While the five guys continue use their unique skills to push themselves to the top, wherever that may be, they all have one thing in common--they know that music is a lifestyle...it gets them from one day to the next.\n\nMusic means love\n\n\nFarewell Unknown is:\nDrew Ochwat-Drums, Bong\nWill Swan-Guitars, Vocals\nAlvaro Alcaca-Guitars, Vocals\nEric Lodge-Bass, Vocals\nJoel Rabara-Vocals\n\n------------------------------------2005-------------------------------------\n\nDrew was replaced by Matt Mingus on drums and Jon Mess did some vocals.
