A shark is roaming the waters, but not your ordinary shark. An ancient species supposedly extinct since 100.000 years. A couple of people die, till the secret of the sharks existent is revealed and Rolf could finish his personal vendetta, since this very shark had killed his wife three year backÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nDid you notice Rolf never took his shirt of in this flick? Great you hire 6'6' actor Moeller and have him act in a leather jacket on a summer vacation island. I don't expect Rolf to act, but pump it up manÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ The story is so flimsy its real hard not to laugh all the time through. Best part is Janet Biedermann, (German starlet) who appears out of nowhere so she can plug her singing career. SFX on the shark aren't too bad for TV, while the sharks teeth are simply laughable. RTL produced this mindless story and shoots huge ratings, that's how TV works ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a93a9430e9fd19cc6435efef42422e9a1e94f09e","amp;dn":"shark+alarm.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a93a9430e9fd19cc6435efef42422e9a1e94f09e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,58,148,48,233,253,25,204,100,53,239,239,66,66,46,154,30,148,240,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
