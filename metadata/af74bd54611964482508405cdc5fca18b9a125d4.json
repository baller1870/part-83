Raised in eastern North Carolina, Wells learned to play harmonica as a young child and taught himself to play the guitar as he developed a strong interest in traditional blues and folk music. His many years of public performance began in Chapel Hill, N.C. in the early 1970s. During the following decades he has presented his brand of acoustic blues throughout North Carolina, the United States and Europe.\n\nShake 'em On Down offers 17 solo acoustic tracks featuring country blues, old-time country, and early popular songs.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af74bd54611964482508405cdc5fca18b9a125d4","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Lightnin%5C%27+Wells+-+Shake+%5C%27Em+On+Down","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af74bd54611964482508405cdc5fca18b9a125d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,116,189,84,97,25,100,72,37,8,64,92,220,95,202,24,185,161,37,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
