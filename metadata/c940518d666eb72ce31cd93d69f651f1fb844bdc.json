He did this 10 years before radio got its &quot;start&quot; in the early 1920s. The quality is pretty good for a 15yr old VHS tape. I cleaned up the audio a bit as well as the video. This is my first torrent so if something isn't working please post a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c940518d666eb72ce31cd93d69f651f1fb844bdc","amp;dn":"Broadcasting%5C%27s+Forgotten+Father+-+The+Charles+Herald+Story.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c940518d666eb72ce31cd93d69f651f1fb844bdc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,64,81,141,102,110,183,44,227,28,217,61,105,246,81,241,251,132,75,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
