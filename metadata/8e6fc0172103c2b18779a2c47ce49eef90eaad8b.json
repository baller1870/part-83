The scene is narrated by Ramirez (Jacob Vargas) who mentions that his mother told him stories of the Devil roaming the earth, and it always begins with a suicide. Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) is called to the scene to aid in the investigation. Bowden is a recovering alcoholic devastated by the death of his wife and child in a hit-and-run accident by a driver who was never caught. As this is happening, five strangers, who have committed various crimes in the past, step onto an elevator located within the same building where the suicide has taken place.\n\nThe five strangers are Ben (Bokeem Woodbine), a temp security guard with a violent past; an elderly woman (Jenny O'Hara) who is a kleptomaniac; Vince (Geoffrey Arend), a mattress salesman who moonlights as a con artist; Tony (Logan Marshall-Green), a former mechanic who served in the U.S. Marine Corps during the War in Afghanistan who is now seeking employment within the building; and Sarah (Bojana Novakovic), a blackmailing gold-digger meeting with her lawyer in the building.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e6fc0172103c2b18779a2c47ce49eef90eaad8b","amp;dn":"Devil.2010.PPVRip-IFLIX+++%28BX%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e6fc0172103c2b18779a2c47ce49eef90eaad8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,111,192,23,33,3,194,177,135,121,162,196,124,228,158,239,144,234,173,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
