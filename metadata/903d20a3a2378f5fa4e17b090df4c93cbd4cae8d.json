Ms. Andrews deserves\nnot only a dinner on the house, but the best dinner we can muster, even\nif we have to blame the cockroaches for having to forgive her bill.\n\nWe will soon have an HD DivX widescreen 2GB version for all to share\n\nwe ask for your seeding support for Franch language constituents!! \n\nwith thanks!\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:903d20a3a2378f5fa4e17b090df4c93cbd4cae8d","amp;dn":"Victor+Victoria+1982+%28DivX%29+version+Francais+-+Michael+Rizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"903d20a3a2378f5fa4e17b090df4c93cbd4cae8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,61,32,163,162,55,143,95,164,225,123,9,13,244,201,60,189,76,174,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
