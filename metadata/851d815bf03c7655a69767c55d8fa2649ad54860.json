Garrett - The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid (unabridged) - Read by Daniel Luna\n\n\nSource Internet\nDuration approx 5:30 hours\nFhG MPEG 1 Layer III 64 Kbps CBR\n44100Hz, 16-bit, Mono\n\nI feel it only right that you should note that the quality of this book is &quot;variable&quot;, there are passages that are distinctly &quot;tinny&quot; and some that are slightly &quot;muffled&quot; (overenthusiastic noise reduction IMHO), however overall the clear diction of the reader saves it from being a disaster.\n\n\nThe book\n\nReputed to have killed his first man at the age of twelve, William Bonney went on to gun his way into Western legend as Billy the Kid. When he was finally shot himself at the age of twenty-one, the Kid was famous throughout the country as the boy who, so he boasted, had killed a man for every year of his life. This is the story of William Bonney as told by the lawman who ended his notorious career. While explaining the public sympathy that the citizens of the Southwest often accorded youths like Bonney, Garrett challenges the glorified legends of the Kid, offering instead the more genuine story of a young, reckless cowhand who became a hired gun.\n\nCombining the best elements of eyewitness history with the dramatic flair of a great Western novel, this is the clearest account we have of the meteoric career of a man some thought of as a murdering fiend, and others as the Robin Hood of the Southwest.\n\n\nThe author\n\nPatrick &quot;Pat&quot; Floyd Garrett (June 5, 1850 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ February 29, 1908) was an American Old West lawman, bartender, and customs agent who was best known for killing Billy the Kid. He was also the sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:851d815bf03c7655a69767c55d8fa2649ad54860","amp;dn":"The+Authentic+Life+of+Billy+the+Kid+-+Pat+Garrett++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"851d815bf03c7655a69767c55d8fa2649ad54860","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,29,129,91,240,60,118,85,166,151,103,197,93,143,162,100,154,213,72,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
