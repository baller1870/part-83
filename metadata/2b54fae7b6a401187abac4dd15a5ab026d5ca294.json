You can dance to these beats at a party, nod your head while sipping mojitos on the deck or make your rap-hating buddy admit maybe it's not so bad.\n\nAll of these songs have either intelligent lyrics, a killer rhythm or sick breaks - and a few have it all.\n\nFor those of you that like your rap hard-core, not the torrent for you. There is also not a single track by Jay-Z, T-Payne, Lil Wayne, Eminimen, or anyone else that has ever been on a top40 track.
