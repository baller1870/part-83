The sound effects\nare truly powerful too. We converted from a bluray 1080p version of Der Pianist\nas that provides a movie file WITH NO HARD CODED SUBS! This means you can use\nyour own subtitles (if we havent included them for you here already) in any\nlanguage at all! \n\nThe subtitles we found for you and adjusted for starting time as appropriate\n(most of the subs we found were for the bluray English version, whereas the\nGerman version has padding of about 15 seconds at he beginning of the movie\nwhere a &quot;splash screen&quot; is shown of the German movie promoters, (as found on\nthe disc, in how the movie disc was made).\n\nHere are the subtitles included for you this time around:\n\nGerman\nDutch\nEnglish\nFrench\nSwedish\nNorwegian\nFinnish\nDanish\nHungarian\nPolish\nSerbian\nPortuguese\nSlovak\nRomanian\nGreek\n\n\nA personal opinion as a movie reviewer and faithful servant of British\nculture that is Irish at heart:\n\nThis movie tells a lot about the mistakes made by the German nation in its\npolicies of extermination of peoples in mass numbers that were victims \nto clearly indicriminate cruelty and brutal injustice. This haunts the\nconscience of the great peoples of Germany to this very day, and must be\nbrought into rational perspective as to what occured so that dissonance\ncan be brought to a saner resolution, towards a better future as a peoples\nof greatest spirit and moral integrity at the core nonetheless.\n\nIn all that I have learned in my schooling as a British fan, I have to say\nthat I have never encountered a better way to live than that which is espoused\nby what is truly the best idealism that the British have to teach in what is\ntheir actual best example to us all. We maintain a French spirit in respect\nof what is in fact a mosaic of various peoples of Europe even including the\nGreatest Germanic (Dutch) peoples of Holland in their respective contribution\nto the best/greatest European wisdom.\n\nAnd the Irish of course - most important of all in maintaining our Christianly\nsanity in all we encounter in our struggles as a Euro nation together. Many \nother areas around there have contributions to make equally in some respect too.\n\nYet in all of this I never saw anything that wasnt in fact German in its beauty.\nAll of what I respect of British teachings that make me strive to be a person of\ngreat calling in the practice of proper conduct as a human being, to live in the\nright spirit, actually comes from the German heritage that makes up what is the\nBritish legacy of its best wisdom, guided by an Irish spirit that is just as much\nGerman as it is British related in any way shape or form.\n\nYet we saw the travesty I speak of (as we see in this movie) unfold as Germany\nwas at the mercy of a madman named Adolph Hitler who taught the wrong way to perceive supremacy, or to seek its attainment or victory.\n\nThese were instead the methods that destroy the spirit of all human beings,\nincluding the best of the folks of Germany who should have ben spared this\nmadness of Hitler - a man who lacked what is the true German spirit (of kindness\nand generosity with competence)- altogether. Indeed a good many Germans lost \ntheir lives as Hitler doomed them to suicide towards the end of the war, with no\nregard for their value whatever!\n\nFor this his memory will live in shame throughout history as an imbecilic human\nfreak who had no idea of human worth, and that is certainly seen in what all of\nhis victims in seeing this movie have had to endure as a result of!\n\nThe greatness of the peoples of Germany will never wither away, as it will remain\nthe saving grace for us all towards a better future - it comes mainly from the\nGerman nation maintaining its perspective in where it is that true greatness lies\n- in the beauty of its strenght in achieving competence, while maintaining a true\nIrish spirit. Best to kep this in mind, or we will lose a lot more than the world\ncould ever afford to - our saving grace in what it is Germany holds in its future\nfor the world as the Leader on the podium giving us a truly saner voice than what\nit is we now hear from elsewhere on just about every matter of human concern.\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9936f84fb207ffed8c0cef2c01425e164b4c2fa7","amp;dn":"Der+Pianist+%28720p+DivX+HD%29+dual+German-English+%28moviesbyrizzo%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9936f84fb207ffed8c0cef2c01425e164b4c2fa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,54,248,79,178,7,255,237,140,12,239,44,1,66,94,22,75,76,47,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
