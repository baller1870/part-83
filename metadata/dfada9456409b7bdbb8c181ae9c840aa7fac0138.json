The album opens with a jazzy cover of Toy Caldwell's &quot;Bob Away My Blues,&quot; complete with horns. The sound is very uptown and snazzy, and Black sings the hell out of the song. This track may not exactly set the mood of the album, but it sure states the mindset. Black pulls tunes from all over the ballpark: Eric Idle's &quot;Galaxy Song,&quot; Leon Russell's &quot;Dixie Lullaby,&quot; and a slightly revised cover of Waylon Jennings' &quot;Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way&quot; (titled &quot;Are You Sure Waylon Done It This Way&quot;). Black also wrote/co-wrote several songs, including &quot;Hand in the Fire&quot; and &quot;Been There.&quot; His wife, Lisa Hartman-Black, sings with him on &quot;When I Said I Do,&quot; and she's believable. He also includes rearranged versions of his hit singles &quot;Burn One Down&quot; and &quot;No Time to Kill.&quot; Guest players include Jennings, Bruce Hornsby, Jerry Douglas, Stuart Duncan, and Steve Wariner. Amid the welter of ideas, players, and influences at work here, Black's singing shines through. When it's all said and done, D'lectrified is a pretty wonderful album, easily the most musical record Black has ever done. ~ Philip Van Vleck, All Music Guide\n\n\n01. Bob Away My Blues 3:06\n02.
