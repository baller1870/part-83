This outing features Newton with three string players (violinists John Blake and Gayle Dixon and cellist Abdul Wadud) and a four-piece rhythm section (vibraphonist Jay Hoggard, pianist Kenny Kirkland, bassist Cecil McBee and drummer Billy Hart). Each of the five numbers has its purpose, including \\&quot;Mr. Dolphy\\&quot; (a tribute to Eric Dolphy), Wayne Shorter\\'s moody \\&quot;Anna Maria,\\&quot; and a three-part suite about South Africa (\\&quot;Diamonds Are for Freedom\\&quot;). Well worth several listens.
