He and his friend Titus Twimbly transform themselves into the masked marvels Rat Pfink &amp; Boo Boo, the champions of down-trodden, harassed and just plain put-upon women and children everywhere. Unleashing their trusty metal steed The Ratcycle, the dynamic duo begin their search for Cee Bee, checking out go-go parties where rock n\\\\\\' roll-besotted youth dance the watusi. Narrowly escaping many dangers, Rat Pfink &amp; Boo Boo defeat the Chain Gang and rescue Cee Bee, but their pleasure in a job well down is cut short when they are threatened by Kogar the Ape, who has escaped from a local zoo. After defeating the rampaging primate, the three are the celebrants at a parade held in their honor. \\\\\\&quot;Rat Pfink a Boo Boo\\\\\\&quot; is a Crime-Stoppers Textbook classic that proves that the American Way always triumphs over vice in the end.
