We will clean up\nour list for those that didnt make it well enough (our older Xvids mainly).\n\n\nThis is a conversion fron a 2GB HD mkv file to a format that is playable\non ordinary DivX disc players that dont have HD capability normally -\nyet are looking to produce a nice picture quality such as this rich looking\nmasterpiece (compared to a version we just converted from an NTSC DVD9\nDVD, there is no doubt you get a better picture if you use HD source content\nmaterial so a guy can get a nicer movie even if he doesnt have the dough\nto give up on his beers to buy expensive equipment and discs for HD normally).\n\nWe normally have been converting from large 6GB - 15GB mkv bluray sourced\nfiles to get this quality, so as to make accesible movie file versions for\nwhat most people have for equipment at the present time. \n\n \nAbout &quot;Tin Men&quot;:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094155/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094155/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis is another movie that ranks among my personal favourites.\n\nTin Men is an excellent human story that comes to us from\nHollywood to describe the life of the door to door salesman\nwho's looking to make a quick killing as it were, throughout\nhis working hours.\n\nI know something of this business as I sold vaccum cleaners\nmyself while in high school for some pocket money as it were\nas my parents had no ability to come up with anything in this\nregard given their high mortgage and other expenses.\n\nAlthough I didn't use the door to door approach (I was\ngiven pre-arranged appointments to show off the \n&quot;Filter Queen&quot; products (by the way, they are the\nbest in the business, even these several decades \nlater I find when I shop for a vaccum personally -\nthere are deals to be found in older used ones\nin shops around town in any event), I have a lot\nof understanding for the business and characters\nthat are depicted in the movie.\n\nIt's sad when a culture evolves in such a manner\nthat people simply don't feel that they are always\ndealing with their own kin, in a way as to make\nfor a conscionable existence by comparison for\nexample to what you will find in most communities\nin Europe. Even in Russia with the mob now operating\nthere, there is a sense of community that endures\nand that will never be destroyed to the extent of seeing\neach person in your midst as only a means to an end.\n\nThat unfortunately is the message of this movie \nand others like &quot;Death of a salesman&quot; and many\nother such examples in fact.\n\nIf folks are to you just a prospect for a sale\nand you don't care how its done, then I'm afraid\nyou lack a good enough existence to teach any\nof your wisdom, in this regard. I think we should\nlearn from Europe instead. Better still, there's\nJessica Lange who could set it all up for us as\ngood Christians to show the world a better way.\n\nIt shows in all that people say and do and feel towards\none another, and the madness you see displayed in this\nmovie in what is insensitive or unfair is an example\nin all of this, I think - quite clearly!\n\nNonetheless, its a great comedy for those that enjoy this \ngenre, and I always will feel close to the characters \ngiven my own background even though I'm 100% the \nopposite in being concerned with integrity, while the \nscripted characters in the movie are clearly not. As such, \nthe feeling is superficial, however it is there and quite \nemphatically so.\n\nGreat movies such as this and others that\nwe show off here are either not well enough\nadvertised or promoted, or they are simply\nwritten off by the industry to the point where\nthey refuse to make them even available - at any\nprice - go figure!\n\nI hope to see the industry make a fortune with our\nefforts here, provided they put the DVDs on the shelves \nat just five bucks each. That's fair for all and its a\nricher scheme than what they've got going now.\nAnd more sensible too. (For the community minded).\n\nIncludes nice songs from the sountrack (for your ipod or \nhome stereo - r even at the local cafe jukebox collection perhaps)\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47c516343ff85a5d7e905bb69d3191e62958e2c4","amp;dn":"Tin+Men+%28converted+from+HD+720p%29+Michael+Rizzo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47c516343ff85a5d7e905bb69d3191e62958e2c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,197,22,52,63,248,90,93,126,144,91,182,157,49,145,230,41,88,226,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
