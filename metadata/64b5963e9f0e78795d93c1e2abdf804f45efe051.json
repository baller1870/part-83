One hour with news as you do not see it elsewhere.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- Chilean Economist Manfred Max-Neef on Barefoot Economics, Poverty and Why The U.S. is Becoming an &quot;Underdeveloping Nation&quot;\n\nWe speak with the acclaimed Chilean economist, Manfred Max-Neef. He won the Right Livelihood Award in 1983, two years after the publication of his book Outside Looking In: Experiences in Barefoot Economics. &quot;Economists study and analyze poverty in their nice offices, have all the statistics, make all the models, and are convinced that they know everything that you can know about poverty. But they don't understand poverty,&quot; Max-Neef says.\n\n\n- Author and Activist Derrick Jensen: &quot;The Dominant Culture is Killing the Planet...It's Very Important for Us to Start to Build a Culture of Resistance&quot;\n\nWe speak with Derrick Jensen, who has been called the poet-philosopher of the ecological movement. He has written some 15 books critiquing contemporary society and the destruction of the environment. His many books include A Language Older than Words, Endgame, What We Left Behind, Resistance against Empire, and Deep Green Resistance. &quot;I think a lot of us are increasingly recognizing that the dominant culture is killing the planet,&quot; Jensen says. &quot;I think it's very important for us to start to build a culture of resistance, because what we're doing isn't working, clearly.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64b5963e9f0e78795d93c1e2abdf804f45efe051","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+26+nov+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64b5963e9f0e78795d93c1e2abdf804f45efe051","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,181,150,62,159,14,120,121,93,147,193,226,171,223,128,79,69,239,224,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
