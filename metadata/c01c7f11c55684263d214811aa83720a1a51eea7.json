In August 2007, the show was renewed for three more seasonsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½13, 14 and 15ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½each of them containing 14 episodes.\nSouth Park is an American animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become infamous for its crude, surreal, satirical, and dark humor that lampoons a wide range of topics. The ongoing narrative revolves around four childrenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and their bizarre adventures in and around the fictional and titular Colorado town.\nParker and Stone developed the show from two animated shorts they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet viral videos, which ultimately led to its production as a series. South Park debuted on August 13, 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied, but the show remains Comedy Central's highest rated and longest running program. A total of 209 episodes have been broadcast, and the fourteenth season began airing on March 17, 2010. Parker and Stone, who continue to do most of the writing, directing, and voice acting, are under contract to produce 14 new episodes in April 27, 2011.[2] Originally produced by cutout animation, each episode is now created with computer software that emulates the show's distinct style.\nFollowing the early success of the series, the feature length musical film South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut had a widespread theatrical release in June 1999. South Park has also received numerous media awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards. The show has also garnered a Peabody Award for Comedy Central.\n\nEncoded for all iPods, PSP's &amp; Zunes.\n\nPlease comment on the quality &amp; remember to seed atleast 1:1.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c01c7f11c55684263d214811aa83720a1a51eea7","amp;dn":"South+Park+S14E03-14+%28PSP%2C+iPod%2C+Zune%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c01c7f11c55684263d214811aa83720a1a51eea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,28,127,17,197,86,132,38,61,33,72,17,170,131,114,10,26,81,238,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
