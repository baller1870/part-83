Kelley has recorded for Hollywood Records, Threshold Records and DNK Records as a pop rock artist, and has had four hit singles on the Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart. His songs &quot;Amazing&quot; and &quot;Only You&quot; made top ten on that chart.\n\nIn 2010, Kelley signed to MCA Nashville and began a country music career. His debut single on the format, &quot;Georgia Clay&quot;, has become a Top 40 hit on the Hot Country Songs charts. Kelley is the brother of Lady Antebellum member Charles Kelley.\n\nKelley was born in Augusta, Georgia, the son of Gayle and Dr. John W. Kelley, a cardiologist. Kelley began his musical career at the age of 11. His younger brother, Charles Kelley, is also a musician and singer in the country trio Lady Antebellum. Kelley started at 11 with his guitar. While he was a teenager, he and his brother Charles formed a band called Inside Blue. By the time he was 14, the band released a CD with five songs in it which led to a meeting with James Brown.\n\nKelley attended the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi and is a member of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity.\n\nKelley released his independent album, Changing Faces, in 2001 and signed with Hollywood Records in 2002. Working with John Alagia as his producer, Kelley released the album, For the Ride Home, on June 3, 2003. The album featured his hit song &quot;Amazing,&quot; which most people know him by. He also made an appearance at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in 2003.\n\nEven though Kelley has stated that the lyrics from his song &quot;Angeles&quot; were fabricated, he moved to Los Angeles from Georgia and recorded the majority of his second album, Almost Honest, in the studio of his home. Almost Honest was released on August 23, 2005, and featured the hit single, &quot;Only You.&quot;\n\nAfter asking to be released from his contract with Hollywood Records, Kelley released his third album, Just Say The Word under his own label named Threshold. The digital version of the album was released through iTunes on June 6, 2006, while the physical album was released in stores in the United States on July 25, 2006. &quot;The Pop Game&quot; was the first single from his self-produced album and was accompanied by a cartoon video.\n\nKelley's next album, Special Company, was released in the United States on January 14, 2008. His label, Threshold, was renamed DNK Records so as to avoid confusion with another record label by the same name. Kelley also released a digital album that summer titled Backwoods on July 7. Later that year, Kelley released his latest album, To Remember, on September 23 exclusively through Target stores. The title track was also included on the AT&amp;T Team USA Soundtrack.\n\nKelley has toured with many artists including Rod Stewart, Third Eye Blind, Toby Lightman, Counting Crows, and Ryan Cabrera.\n\nKelley remains a supporter of file sharing applications for independent artists who have a difficult time receiving an audience. In fact, Kelley was &quot;found&quot; after targeting Eric Clinger at Hollywood Records with private spam, &quot;If you like James Taylor, Try Josh Kelley,&quot; messages using the Napster program.\n\nIn November 2009, Kelley signed with MCA Nashville and began recording his first country album in 2010. The album's first single, &quot;Georgia Clay&quot;, was released to country radio in August 2010. The single has become a Top 40 hit on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591389b248089cc8a1f7240de5e2b0a351cbe88d","amp;dn":"Josh+Kelley+-+Georgia+Clay+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591389b248089cc8a1f7240de5e2b0a351cbe88d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,19,137,178,72,8,156,200,161,247,36,13,229,226,176,163,81,203,232,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
