Sacrificing his own well\nbeing to save his damsel in distress. Super Meat Boy brings the old\nschool difficulty of classic NES titles like Mega Man 2, Ghost and\nGoblins and Super Mario Bros. 2 (The Japanese one) and stream lines\nthem down to the essential no BS straight forward twitch reflex\nplatforming.\nRamping up in difficulty from hard to soul crushing SMB will drag\nMeat boy though haunted hospitals, salt factories and even hell\nitself.
