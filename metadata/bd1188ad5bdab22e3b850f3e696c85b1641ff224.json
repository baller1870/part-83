In this bad situation, there was little hope of any human intervention or help at all, so things looked quite bad.\nThere were glimpses of hope shining now and then, but nothing substantial, humanly speaking.\nThen something happened that changed the whole situation..\n\n\nI can not give away more than that, I can only add that the story is told by the missionaries themselves, and that it's a great movie that many have reacted upon with a renewed hope and a rekindled faith in their hearts as result.\n\nMay it be of joy and help to many.\n\nIn Jesus' Name,\n\nV.\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;fc8a998e959a958e99919d9590bc9b919d9590d29f9391&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd1188ad5bdab22e3b850f3e696c85b1641ff224","amp;dn":"God+At+The+Controls+%5BVHS-RIP+-+XviD%5D+%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd1188ad5bdab22e3b850f3e696c85b1641ff224","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,17,136,173,91,218,178,46,59,133,15,62,105,108,133,177,100,31,242,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
