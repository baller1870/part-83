His first band, Queen Elizabeth, were short lived, his next, the Backstreet Boys, recorded an album in New York only to see it never released, although tracks did turn up on the Max's Kansas City album (a favorite of the late UK DJ John Peel). By 1976 Wayne was back in the UK with a new outfit, the Electric Chairs, who rapidly became one of the most booked bands on the UK punk circuit. The following year they were to record their most notorious tracks, F*ck Off!, which was released as a single and sold very well indeed. The critically and commercially successful Storm the Gates of Hell LP really put The Electric Chairs on the map, and they became international cult favorites. In 1980 Wayne decided it was time to address his gender issues once and for all, and following surgery he became Jayne County.\n\nDuring the 80's Jayne moved to Berlin, performing on the underground circuit, and virtually disappearing from the public eye. By the mid-nineties the UK Punk revival was in full swing and Jayne was tempted out of obscurity to form a revamped Electric Chairs and once more hit the stage doing what she did best. As lewd and irreverent as she had been twenty years earlier, Jayne introduced a whole new generation to her tasteless, gender bending, trashy world and in the process won herself a whole new fan base, leading to the recording come back LP Deviation and a best selling autobiography Man Enough to Be a Woman. This DVD was recorded at the 20th Birthday of Punk Celebration, 'Holidays in The Sun', held at the Winter Gardens in August 1995 and contains mostly never-been-seen footage of that very special gig. Watch, be amazed and realize why Jayne County remains the true, uncrowned Queen of Punk Rock.\n\nSONG LIST:\n\n- I hate today\n- Night time\n- Wonder Woman\n- Paranoia Paradise\n- Bad in bed\n- Are you a boy or are you a girl?\n- Man enough to be a woman\n- Rock &amp; Roll Resurrection\n- (If you don't want to f*ck me) F*ck off\n- Brainwashed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e5e33d754351b20f1273a0f928d914eacbee8bf","amp;dn":"DVDRip+Jayne+County+And+The+Electric+Chairs+-+Man+Enough++A+Woma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e5e33d754351b20f1273a0f928d914eacbee8bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,94,51,215,84,53,27,32,241,39,58,15,146,141,145,78,172,190,232,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
