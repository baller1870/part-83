RESTRICTIONS AND WARNING\n---------------------------\n\nWARNING:\n* Do not re-patch any of third-party BPL file after installed, otherwise it might raise unexpected errors.\n* On the replacement for the original RTL D2007 RTL / VCL, although the D2007 uses FastMM RTL memory management, faster and better than the D7 RTL, but carefully chosen to use, if the replacement RTL, all from the base of the VCL began to re-build, and some No source file may be unable to compiled and used, the use of the process of possible instability. Replacement after the installation of third-party Components, please do not use the built-in tools, or use the command line to compile, open and compile to install dpk from the IDE menus. Not all users recommended to replace,Only recommended for the component of the Delphi compile &amp; installed very skilled and all installed component have the sources. If you just want Delphi7 support XP / Vista API and the new properties, select the &quot;Replace Windows's pas(Supports New Vista API &amp; Attribute) only (Maximum compatibility)&quot; Instead of &quot;Replace with Delphi2007's RTL / VCL&quot; to ensure maximum compatibility.\n\n8.
