The main problem with the precious metal is that, in some transactions there is no real, physical silver and what the investor gets in return for his money is paper silver. Some federal banks have pursued the trend for a quite long time and continue to do add to their huge pile of liability by issuing more and more paper silver. The manipulation is feared to leave a huge impact on the market in the long run.\nMax interviews David Morgan. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://silver-investor.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://silver-investor.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.\n\nYou can watch the video at these links:\n\npart 1 of 3\n\npart 2 of 3\n\npart 3 of 3\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
