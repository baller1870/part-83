Issue 67. December 2010.\n\nEnglish | 104 pages | PDF | 70.82 Mb\n\nNZV8 Magazine was conceived when the passionate muscle car scene was in \nneed of an authority. Thanks to a large population of baby boomers, muscle \ncar and V8 culture is starting to boom again in New Zealand. NZV8 is not \nonly riding that wave, but leading the way by providing world class magazine \nthat features the cars, events and people that make the scene so exciting. \nNZV8 covers an extensive range of high-performance V8-engine vehicles. \nWherever the local ground shakes to the beat of a tuned eight-cylinder \nmachine, NZV8 is part of the action.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23dfb7b258a5455771f755bdcad2eb62253457bb","amp;dn":"NZV8+Magazine.+Issue+67.+December+2010.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23dfb7b258a5455771f755bdcad2eb62253457bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,223,183,178,88,165,69,87,113,247,85,189,202,210,235,98,37,52,87,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
