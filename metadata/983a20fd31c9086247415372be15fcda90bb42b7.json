Santa\n      Claus and the Snow Queen will be there, as, of course, will all\n      the favourite River Cottage regulars, including Hugh, his chefs\n      Tim and Gill, preserves queen, Pam Corbin, and foraging expert\n      John Wright. But the food will very much be the star of the\n      show. In an evening of traditional festive British foods, look\n      out for deliciously different ways to stuff a roast goose; a\n      trio of recipes for that wonderful winter root celeriac; Hugh's\n      take on a sweet chutney; luxuriously rich Christmas bread; and\n      tips for how to fill the perfect hamper with hand made edible\n      goodies. They also share their road-tested hangover cures to aid\n      the inevitable morning after the night before of pure\n      indulgence. The River Cottage team also create their own version\n      of a wonderful Christmas grotto, minus the seemingly obligatory\n      piece of tinsel, and make their own brand of Christmas crackers.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
