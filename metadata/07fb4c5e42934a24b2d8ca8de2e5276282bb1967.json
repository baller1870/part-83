She will soon serve as a catalyst for a disparate group of supposed heretics, the Resistance,launching them into civil war.\n\nRiese (Christine Chatelain), a wanderer, travels across the decaying lands of Eleysia with her wolf, Fenrir. Marked as a heretic by religious group The Sect and the new Empress, Amara, Riese must evade their assassins and discover their true intentions for Eleysia.\n\nEleysia is a dying kingdom where resources are dwindling and compassion is fading. Distrust and anxiety have clouded peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s minds, causing a regression into primitive ways of thinking. People have grown restless, almost feral.
