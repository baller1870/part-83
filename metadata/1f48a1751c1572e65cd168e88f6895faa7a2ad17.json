Every\n      comedy writer has been influenced in some way by what came\n      before, and they are certainly no different. By revealing what\n      makes up their own comedy DNA, they show what inspired them to\n      create Father Ted and the rest of the Craggy Islanders. There\n      are clips from some comedy classics that you would expect - such\n      as Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses, Seinfeld and The\n      Simpsons- as well as weird stuff from the real world which\n      inspired some of their favourite characters. They discuss the\n      comedians and stand-ups, the priests, politicians and Irish\n      beauty pageants which have directly influenced their comedy\n      world, as well as their obsession with the feature film The\n      Heartbreak Kid - also being shown on C4 as part of Father Ted\n      Night, lst January, 2011.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
