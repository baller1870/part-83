Language, regardless of the particular dialect spoken, is the tool we use to express our wants, our needs, and our feelings.\n\nRecently, many experts who study language have become convinced by an idea about this remarkable human trait that was, only a few decades ago, utterly revolutionary. These experts believe that the capacity for spoken language and the rules for its structure are not cultural but universalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½a set of rules shared by humans in every culture and that even may be hardwired into our brains. Moreover, these rules apply regardless of which of the world's 6,000 languages are being spoken.\n\nLectures:\n\n1. What Is Linguistics?\n2. The Sounds of LanguageÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Consonants\n3.
