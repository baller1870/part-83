In 2007, he released his games as freeware. Being as old and obscure as it is, who knows when the site (www.plbm.com) could go down. Thus, to preserve these great games, I have taken the liberty of uploading them for all of you to see.  Kurt no longer supports these games, so technical difficulties are your problem.
