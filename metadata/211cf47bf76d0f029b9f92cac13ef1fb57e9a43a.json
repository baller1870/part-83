Ras Mek Peace was recorded using only 2 tracks, one for vocals and one for instruments. Incredibly, the tracks were put together using no mixing board, no filtering, no compression, no equalization, no noise reduction, multitracking or overdubbing.&quot; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:211cf47bf76d0f029b9f92cac13ef1fb57e9a43a","amp;dn":"MIDNIGHT+Ras+Mek+Peace+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"211cf47bf76d0f029b9f92cac13ef1fb57e9a43a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,28,244,123,247,109,15,2,155,159,146,202,193,62,241,251,87,233,164,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
