The name stands for &quot;Operating System/2,&quot; because it was introduced as part of the same generation change release as IBM's &quot;Personal System/2 (PS/2)&quot; line of second-generation personal computers. OS/2 is no longer marketed by IBM, and IBM standard support for OS/2 was discontinued on 31 December 2006.[1] Currently, Serenity Systems sells OS/2 under the brand name eComStation.\n\n-----------------------------\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34f1ff1300c168c4f487e5101972e6fbeb572864","amp;dn":"IBM+OS2+Warp+3+-+Blue+-+8.200+-+Portuguese+-+Diskettes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34f1ff1300c168c4f487e5101972e6fbeb572864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,241,255,19,0,193,104,196,244,135,229,16,25,114,230,251,235,87,40,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
