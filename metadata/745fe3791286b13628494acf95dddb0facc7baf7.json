The Ten Commandments (1923)\n\nTruly one of the greatest spectacles ever produced for the movies, this original version of the Cecil B. DeMille blockbuster is a motion picture that you must see to understand the genius that built the industry. The plot moves back and forth in time to show the relevance of its Old Testament morality to contemporary (circa 1923) immorality. This spectacular production used a cast of thousands and was hailed by the critics for its imaginative use of special effects. The Gaylord Carter score, performed on a magnificent Wurlitzer organ, beautifully captures all the reverence and power that De Mille captured on film.\n\n \n\nDisc 2. The Ten Commandments (1956)\n\nFor sheer pageantry and spectacle, few motion pictures can claim to equal the splendor of Cecil B. DeMilleÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤s 1956 remake of his epic The Ten Commandments. Filmed in Egypt and the Sinai with one of the biggest sets ever constructed for a motion picture, this version tells the story of the life of Moses (Charlton Heston), once favored in the PharaohÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¤s (Yul Brynner) household, who turned his back on a privileged life to lead his people to freedom. With a rare on-screen introduction by Cecil B. DeMille himself, this unforgettable movie experience is enhanced by a Dolby surround stereo soundtrack..\n\nOther features\n\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access\n\nDisc 1\n\n      Commentary by Katherine Orrison, author of \\&quot;Written in Stone: Making Cecil B.
