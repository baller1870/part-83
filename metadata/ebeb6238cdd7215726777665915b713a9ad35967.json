Brokering the incident for political capital, Shaw eventually becomes a vice-presidential nominee, while Marco is haunted by dreams of what happened -- or didn't happen -- in Kuwait.

Is it possible the entire unit was kidnapped and brainwashed to believe Shaw is a war hero as part of a plot to seize the White House? Some very powerful people at Manchurian Global corporation appear desperate to stop him from finding out.&quot;\n\n=========================================================================\n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368008/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368008/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebeb6238cdd7215726777665915b713a9ad35967","amp;dn":"The.Manchurian.Candidate.2004+-+bdrip+-+Arabic+subs+hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebeb6238cdd7215726777665915b713a9ad35967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,235,98,56,205,215,33,87,38,119,118,101,145,91,113,58,154,211,89,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
