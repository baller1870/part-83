Owing a hard-to-miss debt to Scorsese and likely to be pulled from the internet by the Rolling StonesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ copyright lawyers any day now, this veritable labour of love is the flashy, violent tale of a vigilante garbageman, cleaning up whatever (i.e. whoever) the police canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve must confess I didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t make it all the way through (it is, letÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s be honest, far too long, and the voices oh god the voices the voices) but itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s enormously technically impressive. So much so that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s impossible not to suspect itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s much, much more interested in stylised cinematography than involving narrative, with the painful voice acting a very distant third, but in visual terms itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a huge success.\n\nCreator Mathieu Weschler has made GTA IVÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s frankly weird engine sing, presenting a dizzing array of camera angles, slo-mo and assorted post-processing, and demonstrating that, whatever other issues we had with GTA 4ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â²s PC port, Rockstar sure packed a lot of detail into their city. The Trashmaster borrows liberally from every blockbuster youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve ever heard of, but you just canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fault the visual impressiveness. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.festivalscope.com/director/weschler-mathieu&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.festivalscope.com/director/weschler-mathieu&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/01/11/toxic-avenger-the-90-min-gta-iv-movie/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/01/11/toxic-avenger-the-90-min-gta-iv-movie/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/12771/full-featurelength-film-created-with-gtaiv-the-trashmaster.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/12771/full-featurelength-film-created-with-gtaiv-the-trashmaster.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAvailable to stream online via the RockPaperShotgun link.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3653c0f9515a9cb7404eea03964d9b4b974ebcc","amp;dn":"Trashmaster+%28Toxic+Avenger%29+-+90min+GTA+IV+Movie+%5BHQ+MP4%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3653c0f9515a9cb7404eea03964d9b4b974ebcc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,101,60,15,149,21,169,203,116,4,238,160,57,100,217,180,185,116,235,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
