Over his eight year career he (or rather his stage name Iron &amp; Wine) has reached the point in his career where he is nearly synonymous with the modern folk genre. He plans to change this with his new album ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKiss Each Other Clean.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ While 2007ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe ShepherdÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s DogÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was a departure from the acoustic styling of his previous two albums, I have the oddest feeling it will be remembered as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBringing It All Back HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ of Iron &amp; WineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career. With ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKiss Each Other CleanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Iron &amp; Wine is going electric, and as witnessed by the opening track which was released last Friday [November 26, 2010] itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going to be fantastic.\n\nThe songÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalking Far From HomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½has the magnificent lyrics weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve come to associate with Iron &amp; Wine, but with the added benefit of a polished backing instrumentation rarely seen among most musical acts today. It, much like the previous efforts of Iron &amp; Wine, embodies beauty.&quot;\n\n--themusicninja.com\n\nIRON &amp; WINE\nWalking Far From Home EP\nNovember 26, 2010\n\n1.
