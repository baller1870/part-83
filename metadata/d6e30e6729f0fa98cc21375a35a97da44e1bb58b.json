The film was loosely based on the series of children's stories of the same name, but none of the material from any of the novels was used; in fact, it could be said that one of the few resemblances is a doctor who can speak to animals. Notably the pushmi-pullyu, a much loved feature of the books, only makes a very brief appearance in the first scene in which the tiger appears in his cage. The first novel had been originally filmed in 1967 as a musical under the same title, a closer adaptation to the book. However, the earlier film was a box office bomb, but still remains a cult classic and a two-time Academy Award-winner. Although the 1998 film was rated PG-13 by the MPAA, it was marketed as a family film.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6e30e6729f0fa98cc21375a35a97da44e1bb58b","amp;dn":"Backstory+Doctor+Doolittle+%28TV%29+%5B2005%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6e30e6729f0fa98cc21375a35a97da44e1bb58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,227,14,103,41,240,250,152,204,33,55,90,53,169,125,164,78,27,181,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
