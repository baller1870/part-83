ELO were formed to accommodate Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne's desire to create modern rock and pop songs with classical overtones. After Wood's departure following the band's debut record, Lynne wrote and arranged all of the group's original compositions and produced every album.\n\n&quot;Hold on Tight&quot; is track twelve on the band's 1981 album Time, and was the first song released as a single, becoming ELO's last major hit single. The song went top ten in most countries, hitting the top spot in Switzerland, number two in Germany, number four in the UK, and number ten on the US pop chart, as well as number two on the US rock chart. It is known for having a verse sung in French; translated, the verse is essentially a French-language reprise of the first verse of the song.\n\nTime is a concept album by Electric Light Orchestra released in 1981. The album tells the story, through its songs and lyrics, about a man from the 1980s finding himself in the year 2095 and trying to come to terms with being unable to return and adjusting to his new surroundings.\n\n'.' About This Music Video '.' \n\nThe previous year, David Bowie had released his &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; music video which was considered as the most innovative to date at that time.

At the time it was the most expensive ever made at around Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£40,000.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_on_Tight_(ELO_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_on_Tight_(ELO_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaDHBAadd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/CaDHBAadd&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Duration: 00:03:04\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
