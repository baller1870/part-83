The servant Reynaldo, who appears only briefly in a single scene and is often left out of abridged versions of the play, is played by French star Gerard Depardieu, and other appearances by well-known actors include Charlton Heston as the First Player, Robin Williams as the courtier Osric, Richard Attenborough as the English Ambassador, Brian Blessed as the ghost of Hamlet's father, Jack Lemmon as Marcellus, the palace guard, Billy Crystal as the gravedigger, and Rufus Sewell plays Fortinbras. The flashbacks and dream sequences even allow for celebrities appearing in non-speaking roles as characters who are only mentioned in the play: Sir John Gielgud and Dame Judi Dench play Priam and Hecuba (mentioned in the monologue performed by the First Player on his arrival at Elsinore), John Mills plays &quot;Old Norway&quot;, uncle of Fortinbras (mentioned by Claudius and Voltemand), and British comedian Ken Dodd plays Yorick.\n\nIn addition to the film stars, the motion picture also features British theatre stars in tiny roles: for example; Simon Russell Beale plays the second gravedigger, Ray Fearon plays the guard Francisco, Ian McElhinney is Barnardo, and Jeffrey Kissoon plays Fortinbras's captain.\n\nInterpretation\n\nAspects of the film's staging are based on Adrian Noble's recent Royal Shakespeare Company production of the play, in which Branagh had played the title role.[3]\n\nIn a radical departure from previous Hamlet films, Branagh set the internal scenes in a vibrantly colourful setting, featuring a throne room dominated by mirrored doors; film scholar Samuel Crowl calls the setting &quot;film noir with all the lights on.&quot;[4] Branagh chose Victorian era costuming and furnishings, using Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, as Elsinore Castle for the external scenes. Harry Keyishan has suggested that the film is structured as an epic, courting comparison with Ben Hur, The Ten Commandments and Doctor Zhivago.[5] As J. Lawrence Guntner points out, comparisons with the latter film are heightened by the presence of Julie Christie (Zhivago's Lara) as Gertrude.[6]\n\nDespite using a full text, Branagh's film is also very visual; it makes frequent use of flashbacks to depict scenes that are either only described but not performed in Shakespeare's text, such as Hamlet's childhood friendship with Yorick, or scenes only implied by the play's text, such as Hamlet's sexual relationship with Kate Winslet's Ophelia.[7] The film also uses very long single takes for numerous scenes.\n\nBranagh's own interpretation of the title role, by his own admission, was considerably less &quot;neurotic&quot; than others; gone completely was the Oedipal fixation so prominently featured in Olivier's 1948 film. However, some critics, such as Leonard Maltin, felt that Branagh's performance was at times too &quot;over-the top&quot; (in the scenes in which Hamlet pretends to be insane, Branagh portrayed the Prince as manic; other members of the court are visibly exasperated by his behavior).\n\nCast (in credits order) verified as complete\n\nRiz Abbasi\t... \tAttendant to Claudius\nRichard Attenborough\t... \tEnglish Ambassador\nDavid Blair\t... \tAttendant to Claudius\nBrian Blessed\t... \tGhost of Hamlet's Father\nKenneth Branagh\t... \tHamlet\nRichard Briers\t... \tPolonius\nMichael Bryant\t... \tPriest\nPeter Bygott\t... \tAttendant to Claudius\nJulie Christie\t... \tGertrude\nBilly Crystal\t... \tFirst Gravedigger\nCharles Daish\t... \tStage Manager\nJudi Dench\t... \tHecuba\nGÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rard Depardieu\t... \tReynaldo\nReece Dinsdale\t... \tGuildenstern\nKen Dodd\t... \tYorick\nAngela Douglas\t... \tAttendant to Gertrude\nRob Edwards\t... \tLucianus\nNicholas Farrell\t... \tHoratio\nRay Fearon\t... \tFrancisco\nYvonne Gidden\t... \tDoctor\nJohn Gielgud\t... \tPriam\nRosemary Harris\t... \tPlayer Queen\nCharlton Heston\t... \tPlayer King\nRavil Isyanov\t... \tCornelius\nDerek Jacobi\t... \tClaudius\nRowena King\t... \tAttendant to Gertrude\nJeffery Kissoon\t... \tFortinbras's Captain\nSarah Lam\t... \tAttendant to Gertrude\nJack Lemmon\t... \tMarcellus\nIan McElhinney\t... \tBarnardo\nMichael Maloney\t... \tLaertes\nJohn Spencer-Churchill\t... \tFortinbras's Captain (as Duke of Marlborough)\nJohn Mills\t... \tOld Norway\nJimi Mistry\t... \tSailor Two\nSian Radinger\t... \tPrologue\nMelanie Ramsey\t... \tProstitute\nSimon Russell Beale\t... \tSecond Gravedigger\nAndrew Schofield\t... \tYoung Lord\nRufus Sewell\t... \tFortinbras\nTimothy Spall\t... \tRosencrantz\nThomas Szekeres\t... \tYoung Hamlet (as Tom Szekeres)\nBen Thom\t... \tFirst Player\nDon Warrington\t... \tVoltimand\nPerdita Weeks\t... \tSecond Player\nRobin Williams\t... \tOsric\nKate Winslet\t... \tOphelia\nDavid Yip\t... \tSailor One\n\n\nPlot Overview\n\nOn a dark winter night, a ghost walks the ramparts of Elsinore Castle in Denmark. Discovered first by a pair of watchmen, then by the scholar Horatio, the ghost resembles the recently deceased King Hamlet, whose brother Claudius has inherited the throne and married the kingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s widow, Queen Gertrude. When Horatio and the watchmen bring Prince Hamlet, the son of Gertrude and the dead king, to see the ghost, it speaks to him, declaring ominously that it is indeed his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s spirit, and that he was murdered by none other than Claudius. Ordering Hamlet to seek revenge on the man who usurped his throne and married his wife, the ghost disappears with the dawn.\n\nPrince Hamlet devotes himself to avenging his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, but, because he is contemplative and thoughtful by nature, he delays, entering into a deep melancholy and even apparent madness. Claudius and Gertrude worry about the princeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s erratic behavior and attempt to discover its cause. They employ a pair of HamletÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, to watch him. When Polonius, the pompous Lord Chamberlain, suggests that Hamlet may be mad with love for his daughter, Ophelia, Claudius agrees to spy on Hamlet in conversation with the girl. But though Hamlet certainly seems mad, he does not seem to love Ophelia: he orders her to enter a nunnery and declares that he wishes to ban marriages.\n\nA group of traveling actors comes to Elsinore, and Hamlet seizes upon an idea to test his uncleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s guilt. He will have the players perform a scene closely resembling the sequence by which Hamlet imagines his uncle to have murdered his father, so that if Claudius is guilty, he will surely react. When the moment of the murder arrives in the theater, Claudius leaps up and leaves the room. Hamlet and Horatio agree that this proves his guilt. Hamlet goes to kill Claudius but finds him praying. Since he believes that killing Claudius while in prayer would send ClaudiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s soul to heaven, Hamlet considers that it would be an inadequate revenge and decides to wait. Claudius, now frightened of HamletÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s madness and fearing for his own safety, orders that Hamlet be sent to England at once.\n\nHamlet goes to confront his mother, in whose bedchamber Polonius has hidden behind a tapestry. Hearing a noise from behind the tapestry, Hamlet believes the king is hiding there. He draws his sword and stabs through the fabric, killing Polonius. For this crime, he is immediately dispatched to England with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. However, ClaudiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plan for Hamlet includes more than banishment, as he has given Rosencrantz and Guildenstern sealed orders for the King of England demanding that Hamlet be put to death.\n\nIn the aftermath of her fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, Ophelia goes mad with grief and drowns in the river. PoloniusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s son, Laertes, who has been staying in France, returns to Denmark in a rage. Claudius convinces him that Hamlet is to blame for his fatherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and sisterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deaths. When Horatio and the king receive letters from Hamlet indicating that the prince has returned to Denmark after pirates attacked his ship en route to England, Claudius concocts a plan to use LaertesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ desire for revenge to secure HamletÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death. Laertes will fence with Hamlet in innocent sport, but Claudius will poison LaertesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ blade so that if he draws blood, Hamlet will die. As a backup plan, the king decides to poison a goblet, which he will give Hamlet to drink should Hamlet score the first or second hits of the match. Hamlet returns to the vicinity of Elsinore just as OpheliaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s funeral is taking place. Stricken with grief, he attacks Laertes and declares that he had in fact always loved Ophelia. Back at the castle, he tells Horatio that he believes one must be prepared to die, since death can come at any moment. A foolish courtier named Osric arrives on ClaudiusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s orders to arrange the fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes.\n\nThe sword-fighting begins. Hamlet scores the first hit, but declines to drink from the kingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s proffered goblet. Instead, Gertrude takes a drink from it and is swiftly killed by the poison. Laertes succeeds in wounding Hamlet, though Hamlet does not die of the poison immediately. First, Laertes is cut by his own swordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s blade, and, after revealing to Hamlet that Claudius is responsible for the queenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death, he dies from the bladeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s poison. Hamlet then stabs Claudius through with the poisoned sword and forces him to drink down the rest of the poisoned wine. Claudius dies, and Hamlet dies immediately after achieving his revenge.\n\nAt this moment, a Norwegian prince named Fortinbras, who has led an army to Denmark and attacked Poland earlier in the play, enters with ambassadors from England, who report that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. Fortinbras is stunned by the gruesome sight of the entire royal family lying sprawled on the floor dead. He moves to take power of the kingdom. Horatio, fulfilling HamletÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s last request, tells him HamletÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s tragic story. Fortinbras orders that Hamlet be carried away in a manner befitting a fallen soldier.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8ffbe438002a2541b9effa7cec77b04d5337c8a","amp;dn":"Hamlet+%281996+Branagh%29+NTSC+Complete+ISO+DVD+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8ffbe438002a2541b9effa7cec77b04d5337c8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,255,190,67,128,2,162,84,27,158,255,167,206,199,123,4,213,51,124,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
