I\\'ve had a watch on eBay for more than ten solid years and have never seen any other issues offered for sale, so I believe that these four are all there is to the series.  I believe v1 was something they did in college and never saw publication.\n\nThe first one I scanned was v2.2, in April, five months before 9-11, and the issue itself was printed eleven years before that.  It\\'s interesting that on page 11, it says the best way to destroy the World Trade Center is with a 747.\n\nWhen I scanned v2.2 I was using the nick BirdBrain.  I changed it to Neon Vincent before scanning the other three, and that\\'s still my nick in the comics groups and channels today.\n\nI scanned v2.1 and v2.2 at 150 dpi, then went to 200 dpi for the last two.  Now, with our higher resolution monitors, they all seem a bit small.  Perhaps I\\'ll rescan them someday at a yet higher resolution, meantime, thank goodness for CDisplay and its fit to width option.  Also, please note that some individual scans are much narrower than the rest of the pages in that book.  This is because I crop useless white space.  Again, hats off to CDisplay for fitting each page to width.  Finally, note that the scans for 3.1 are larger because it was a larger page than a regular comic book; a magazine size format.\n\nNow about the comics themselves, to quote from-\n\n\\&quot;This comic is the product of a couple of intelligent yet halfwitted New Jersey teenagers being turned loose with paper and pen (their picture is on the back cover).  The artwork (like the authors) is barely junior high school level, but the humor is what really won me over... like \\&quot;Our Side\\&quot;, a takeoff on The Far Side, showing two loaves of bread doing it doggy style, moaning \\&quot;I\\'m crumbing, I\\'m crumbing...\\&quot; or \\&quot;Today\\'s menu:  Eggs Betadine, Tampon ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢  la King, Guitar Strings Marinara, Filet of Moped...\\&quot; - all with appetizing descriptions. Pedestrian juvenile humor abounds, and personally, I love it. My favorites are The Choice Maven and Terminex-Ultra, the playground robot: \\&quot;Red hot liquid death for you...\\&quot;\n\nThe only change I\\'ve made to the entire original scan set is to rotate Anything_But_Monday_v2.2_rco by 90 degrees since it has a landscape orientation.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nNeon Vincent\n20101109\n\n============================================================================\n============================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf3ba50a71d1e82234d21b299cc92565cbcf42e","amp;dn":"Anything+But+Monday+-+Complete+Series+-+CBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf3ba50a71d1e82234d21b299cc92565cbcf42e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,243,186,80,167,29,30,130,35,77,33,178,153,204,146,86,92,188,244,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
