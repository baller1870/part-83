The song's lyrics mainly consist of the singer talking about pictures of his love. Musically, the song features an Oriental Riff played on guitar.\n\nThe song was believed to euphemistically refer to the face a male makes during the act of masturbation. In a VH1 True Spin special the band denied this. Songwriter David Fenton explained: &quot;Turning Japanese is all the cliches about angst and youth and turning into something you didn't expect to.&quot;\n\nThe band knew they had a hit with &quot;Turning Japanese&quot;, so much so that they waited until their second single before releasing it, fearing that if they released it as their first they would become one-hit wonders, but they never matched its success.\n\nThe song enjoyed some sales in the Japanese charts on the back of its huge success in Australia, where it spent two weeks at Number One in June 1980.\n\nIn &quot;Endless, Nameless&quot; the hidden track of Nirvana's 1991 album, Nevermind, Kurt Cobain begins to sing, &quot;I think I'm turning Japanese; I think I'm turning Japanese; I really think so...&quot;\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Japanese&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Japanese&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BAcFcAaDG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/BAcFcAaDG&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8500kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:47\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
