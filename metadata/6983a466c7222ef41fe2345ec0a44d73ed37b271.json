Watch, too, how John shows the motor running under load with the circuit only completed by a strand of wire the diameter of a human hairÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½an impossibility with conventional EM energy.\n\nIs this fanciful talk?  Well, John's manufacturing and production team was rapidly infiltrated and destroyed,  and M.I.T. bought up the last remaining twelve operational units from John, never to see the light of day again, so you can draw your own conclusions.\n\nAlso included is the archival footage from the celebrated 1984 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTown Hall MeetingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Bill Jenkins, in which John springs this technology on an unsuspecting world.\n\nThis DVD is truly historic.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6983a466c7222ef41fe2345ec0a44d73ed37b271","amp;dn":"Energy+From+The+Vacuum+%5B10%5D+-+Kromrey+Konverter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6983a466c7222ef41fe2345ec0a44d73ed37b271","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,131,164,102,199,34,46,244,31,226,52,94,192,164,77,115,237,55,178,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
