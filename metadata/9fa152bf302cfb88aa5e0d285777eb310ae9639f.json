Plug your tomtom device via USB\n\n2. Unrar, copy contents of North_America_P_865_3254 folder to your map folder \n\ndeleting existing files as needed, files would not overwrite for me.\n\n3.Copy and run FastActivate.exe as admin from your gps root folder and push the \n\nfirst, second and third buttons allowing each to do its thing in turn.\n\nOr you can use auotactive.exe from the root folder of your gps, with it there are no additional buttons to push.\n\n4. Disconnect your gps from the computer and wait for it to reboot.\n\nI merely download this stuff from other sites and take no credit or blame.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fa152bf302cfb88aa5e0d285777eb310ae9639f","amp;dn":"TomTom+2+Gig+North+America+map+file+Feb+2011+release","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fa152bf302cfb88aa5e0d285777eb310ae9639f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,161,82,191,48,44,251,136,170,94,13,40,87,119,235,49,10,233,99,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
