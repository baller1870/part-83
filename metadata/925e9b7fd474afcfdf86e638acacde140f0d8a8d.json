Clear picture with some pixelation but the shooting is a bit shaky. (Screenshots a lot blurrier than actual video.) Partially shot on the screen. Audio is very powerful and clear but suffers from some problems (most notably in King of the night time world when there's also serious tape warbling towards the end) and a fairly consistent noise.
