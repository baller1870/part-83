He led his slave army to freedom but then inexplicably turned back to go once again into the jaws of the lion.\n\nHow was this man and his rag-bag army of slaves and other outcasts able to withstand the might of Rome for so long given that they had so many disadvantages to overcome?\n\nMark Corby delves into this mystery and explains how the reality of Spartacus' achievements were far greater than any hollywood film or third rate television series could possibly portray.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3f61adca97415473400ce2921fc8b82a5d0a279","amp;dn":"The+Real+Spartacus+%28Channel+4+-+2001%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3f61adca97415473400ce2921fc8b82a5d0a279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,246,26,220,169,116,21,71,52,0,206,41,33,252,139,130,165,208,162,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
