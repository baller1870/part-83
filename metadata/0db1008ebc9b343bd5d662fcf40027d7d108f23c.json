After a sterling record at a home for &quot;fallen women,&quot; she finds work as a maid for the aristocratic but somewhat impoverished Maxie family, and once installed shows another aspect of her personality: a perverse pleasure in creating unpleasantness for virtually every one who crosses her path. The Maxie family is largely impervious to her machinations... but when Sally goes so far as to tantalize a proposal of marriage from the Maxie son, her game of troubling the water turns lethal, and Scotland Yard's Inspector Dalgliesh is on the job. (GFT)\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0db1008ebc9b343bd5d662fcf40027d7d108f23c","amp;dn":"Cover+Her+Face+-+P+D+James++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0db1008ebc9b343bd5d662fcf40027d7d108f23c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,177,0,142,188,155,52,59,213,214,98,252,244,0,39,215,209,8,242,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
