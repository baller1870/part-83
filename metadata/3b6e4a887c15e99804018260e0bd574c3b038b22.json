From his debut &quot;I Can't Stand Still&quot; to his latest album &quot;Inside Job,&quot; Henley has shown that in an age of teen pop and alternative metal, old-fashioned rock and roll is still alive and kicking. Image Entertainment has released this live concert recorded in Texas from his &quot;Inside Job&quot; tour on DVD.\n\nThis live &quot;remarkable&quot; (so speaketh the DVD packaging) concert was filmed at Fair Park Music Hall in Dallas, Texas, during Henley's newest tour. It looks like a nice area to play in, though the curtained backdrop looks like something Stevie Nicks discarded from her wardrobe back in 1987. Henley, sporting a Priest-like shirt and a hairstyle that looks as if he's been licking light sockets, appears somewhat stiff onstage, but we're not watching to see him to do the truffle-shuffle. We're here for the music.\n\nAlso included in the beginning of this concert is a quick-edit interview of Henley's thoughts onÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦well, everything. He chats about his family and what he's been doing, what he thinks of his music, and what it's like to be onstage in front of an audience. The DVD includes the songs:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Dirty Laundry\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Sunset Grill\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Workin' It\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Taking You Home\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The Boys Of Summer\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Lilah\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Everything is Different Now\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The End Of The Innocence\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ All She Wants To Do Is Dance\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ New York Minute\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Talking To The Moon\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ They're Not Here, They're Not Coming\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The Heart Of The Matter\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Desperado\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ The Long Run\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ My Thanksgiving\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Hotel California\n\nDon Henley: Live Inside Job is presented in it's original 4:3 full frame aspect ratio, and for a concert recording looks remarkably clear. The picture shows no signs of digital artifacts or shimmer, and the colors are bright with no bleeding. Blacks were solid, and for what this is (a concert show) the image is very strong. A very good job by the people over at Image Entertainment. Audio is the strongpoint of the DVD package.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b6e4a887c15e99804018260e0bd574c3b038b22","amp;dn":"Don+Henley+-+Inside+Job+-DVD.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b6e4a887c15e99804018260e0bd574c3b038b22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,110,74,136,124,21,233,152,4,1,130,96,224,189,87,76,59,3,139,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
