It features three new riot arenas (Hellburbia, the Gully and Angelic Ruins) and storage for players' items. The plot of the DLC is Moxxi, a crazed lover who is setting out to find her 4th husband, leading her to make the arenas in the DLC. Players fight several of the game's enemies, including bosses, in arenas. No experience is gained from killing enemies in the arena battles, but experience can be gained from completing challenges or quests in the arena. New game modes are added, such as low gravity fighting, enemy health regeneration, and shieldless fighting. It was released on December 29, 2009 for the Xbox 360 and was released January 7, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and PC.[26] IGN gave Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot a 6.0/10, praising the fact that friends can be added in to play, and stated that everything else needed work. &quot;There's no more gun, money, or ammo drops, and no XP&quot; and stated that &quot;the only decent amount of guns you'll find are in Marcus Kincaid's vendor machine \n\n- wikipedia\n\nI am taking requests for keygens...\n\nPlease email me on\nwe need a Ascii artist, a keygen maker, and a person who can upload large files to the internet\n\nAnyone to help would be great!!!\n\n\n\n           _  _                                            _  _\n      ___ (~ )( ~)                                       (~ )( ~)___\n     /   _ / /             GLMC TEAM                      \\ \\/_/    \\\n    |   D_ ] /                                             \\/ / [ _G|\n    |   D _]/                                              / /\\ [_ G|\n     ___/ / /                                             / /\\ \\ ___/\n          (_ )( _)                                       (_ )( _) \n            ~  ~  \t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee4683f301e6d7f3776081564f0a336294c75739","amp;dn":"Borderlands_Moxxis_Underdome_DLC_GLMC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee4683f301e6d7f3776081564f0a336294c75739","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,70,131,243,1,230,215,243,119,96,129,86,79,10,51,98,148,199,87,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
