Its beauty inspired Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Botticelli. But it also conceals a deeply personal story. It was painted for Cosimo de' Medici, a wealthy banker who feared that his money was dragging him straight to hell. The artist's life was equally surprising. One of the most celebrated painters of his day, Filippo Lippi was also a Carmelite friar, but he was no stranger to the temptations of the flesh.\n\nBBC Site &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x50pd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x50pd&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Spec for HD\nVideo Codec: x264\nVideo Bitrate: 6500 Kbps\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.777:1\nVideo Resolution: 1600x900\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192 Kbps CBR 48KHz\nAudio Channels: 2\nRun-Time: 49 mins\nFramerate: 25FPS\nNumber of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 2.29 GB\nSubtitles: merged (SRT available from MVGroup)\nSource: DVB-S (BBC HD)\n\nThe audio is a bit dodgy at 1 second which lasts for about 1 second. The problem was in the original broadcast although the TS file shows no continuity errors. The source video bitrate was about 6500Kbps average so I've used the same bitrate for encoding. To maintain a quality factor above 0.17 means that the frame size is limited to 1600x900 due to the BBC policy of broadcasting in low bitrate HD.\n\nXvid and external SRT is available from MVGroup\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11c308da8ff3156acc13b925d1c9937b961f5857","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Private+Life+of+a+Christmas+Masterpiece+2010+HDTV+x264+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11c308da8ff3156acc13b925d1c9937b961f5857","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,195,8,218,143,243,21,106,204,19,185,37,209,201,147,123,150,31,88,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
