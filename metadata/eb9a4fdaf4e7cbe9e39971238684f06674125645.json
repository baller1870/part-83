To pass the long hours of the night, he starts working the late night shift at the local supermarket. There he meets a colorful cast of characters, all of whom have their own 'art' in dealing with the boredom of an eight-hour-shift. Ben's art is that he imagines himself stopping time. This way, he can appreciate the artistic beauty of the frozen world and the people inside it - especially Sharon, the quiet checkout girl, who perhaps holds the answer to solving the problem of Ben's insomnia.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9a4fdaf4e7cbe9e39971238684f06674125645","amp;dn":"Cashback.2006.HD.x264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9a4fdaf4e7cbe9e39971238684f06674125645","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,154,79,218,244,231,203,233,227,153,113,35,134,132,240,102,116,18,86,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
