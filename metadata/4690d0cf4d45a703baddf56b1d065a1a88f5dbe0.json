Music, in particular, tends to take major steps forward when emerging acts arrive on the scene with a fresh perspective. Emerging from Los Angeles is Mann, an 18-year-old rapper wise beyond his years whose fresh, positive, inspiring outlook on life provides his debut album, MannÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s World, with a remarkable vibrancy. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a young world,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Mann says. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about being young and enjoying life. Right now, our world is so down and so negative because of whatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s going on. My world is the opposite of that. My world, everything is on the up and up. I appreciate everything that I have and everything that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve gone through to make it to where I am today. The world needs an outlet and the kids need an outlet to be happy. I feel like I can do that with my music.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nCurtis James Jackson III (born July 6, 1975), better known by his stage name 50 Cent, is an American rapper and actor.
