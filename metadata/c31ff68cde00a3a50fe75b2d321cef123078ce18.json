(WTF?!)\n\nBesides that, we thought it was pretty weird when your vobsample was having English, Spanish\nand Portuguese language menus, you did not include those subtitles with your release? Why's that?\nOh right, because they weren't on your source! The best you came up with were English SDH subs only,\nwhich were taken from a bluray source. Just try to rip them with subrip or something, and you'll be\nhaving a hard time. That's because those subtitles were scaled down from a high res bluray to NTSC\nresolution. Our English SDH subs seem to be of greater quality too.\n\nYou'll notice our vobsample will have a fucked up playback. That's because the 3 PGC of the movie cuts\nare overlapping/playing instantly after eachother.\n\nSeeing VAMPS' release history, we're doubting how &quot;retail&quot; their Wall Street 2 release is.\n\nEnjoy a PROPER RETAiL release from EXviD. We'll be doing the EXTENDED version too, which has some\nmore interesting scenes towards the end not included in the theatrical/DC.\n\nThis movie was exactly 13 seconds short of making it a 2CD release, but we decided to do both cuts\non one CD because it compressed rather well.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nLooking for:\n75TB+ Archives\nDUTCH/FLEMiSH Archives\n                                                                                                    \nGreets: CRBS EPiSODE FiCO FLS iLS KLASSiGER LiPSYNC MADE NODLABS RUNNER TNAN       \n   \n\n                                                                    ASCII DONE BY XX^NFO 2oo9","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c31ff68cde00a3a50fe75b2d321cef123078ce18","amp;dn":"Salt.2010.PROPER.DC.DVDRip.XviD-EXViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c31ff68cde00a3a50fe75b2d321cef123078ce18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,31,246,140,222,0,163,165,15,231,91,45,50,28,239,18,48,120,206,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
