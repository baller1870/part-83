This little essay you're reading is meant to accompany these albums for further insight and information into the music and the process of making this all. The most important thing DJ Sinatra would like to make clear is that this is in no way the definitive collection or that these songs are best represented here. Please go out and support the artists you hear in the tracks by buying the stuff you like. This is a celebration of the black films of the seventies, their essence and flavor with context and history. Hopefully you'll be interested enough to find some of these old films if you haven't already and if not then at least enjoy these sweet collections. So here's what you'll be listening to:\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nDisc One:\n\n01. Intro\n02. DMX - Crime Story\n03. Interlude - My Name Is\n04. Bone Thugs ft. Game - The Streets\n05. Wu Tang Clan - Walking Through the Darkness (Exclusive Blend)\n06. Interlude - Sweet Sweetback\n07. Prodigy - Return of the Mack\n08. Interlude - Shaft\\'s Colors\n09. Bun B - 70's Gangsta (Exclusive Blend)\n10. Scarface ft. Too Short, Dr.Dre &amp; Ice Cube - Game Over\n11. Interlude - Superfly\n12. Busta Rhymes &amp; QTip - Wild Hot\n13. Pimp Interlude 1\n14. Ice Cube - Really Doe\n15. Wu Tang Clan - Little Ghetto Boys\n16. Interlude - Dolemite\n17. Compton's Most Wanted - Growin\\' Up In The Hood\n18. Interlude - Ice Berg Slim\n19. Prodigy - Mack 10 Handle\n20. Interlude - Feminism\n21. Ice Cube - Who's the Mack\n22. Interlude - A Step Up\n23. 2Pac - If My Homies Call\n24. Interlude - Fiendish Dr. Wu\n25. Jadakiss &amp; Jay-Z - Reservoir Dogs\n26. Ghostface ft. Raekwon &amp; Ugod - Black Jesus\n27. Raekwon ft. GZA &amp; Slick Rick - We Will Rob You\n28. Interlude - Exploitation\n29. Nas ft. DMX - Life Is What You Make It\n30. Busta Rhymes - Canon\n31. Pimp Interlude 2\n32. Snoop Dogg - Like This\n33. Interlude - Kung Fu Treachery\n34. Young Jeezy - Don't Do It\n35. Outro\n\nThis is the mixtape proper. Hosted by Ice-T, this disc features music from hip hop artists only when they've sampled music from a blaxploitation film. For example; the theme from Shaft recorded by Isaac Hayes was sampled for a song by Jay-Z called Reservoir Dogs and then is edited so only the two best verses (Jay-Z and Jadakiss) remain. This is done for time and for flow. Sometimes a track is great, but at this point in the mix you want to move quickly and not stop for a five minute song.\n\nThe interludes take you through some of the main characters in these films accompanied by different quotes and cuts from the actual movies.\n\nThere are also two tracks exclusively remixed for this mixtape.\n\nAs I said before, this is not a definitive list and in fact there many other tracks sampling blaxploitation scores that were left off for various reasons. Little Ghetto Boy for instance just seemed a little too obvious and over played. Where as Redman's Creepin' just didn't fit into the flow of the album anywhere. Below is a list of tracks that weren't used but could have been.\n\nDr. Dre - Little Ghetto Boy\nRedman - Creepin\\'\nSnoop Dogg - Dolmite\nGangstarr - Next Time\nGangstarr - Take A Rest\nTI - Help Is Coming\nQuasimoto feat. Mr. Herb -Discipline 99 Part 0\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nDisc 2:\n\n01. Welcome 2 Side Two\n02. Bobby Womack - Across 110th Street\n03. Interlude - Foxy Brown\n04. Roy Ayers - Coffy Is The Color\n05. Joe Simon - Theme From Cleopatra Jones\n06. Isaac Hayes - Theme From Shaft\n07. Marvin Gaye - T Plays It Cool\n08. Pimp Interlude Prelude\n09. Edwin Star - Easin' In\n10. Lalo Shifrin - The Human Fly\n11. Gene Page - Blacula Strikes\n12. Bobby Womack - Across 110th Street Intstrumental\n13. Interlude - Christie Love\n14. Marvin Gaye - T Stands For Trouble\n15. Interlude - Vengeance\n16. Pointer Sisters - You Gotta Believe\n17. Donny Hathaway - Little Ghetto Boy\n18. Roy Ayers - Coffy Sauna\n***Bonus Tracks***\n19. Hell Razah - Cinematic\n20. Dolemite Vs. Big Daddy Kane\n\nThis disc is a collection of songs that were sampled to make the beats on disc one. This is fantastic music in it's own right and it only seemed right to celebrate the original music and give credit where it's due. Also because I had an excess of interlude material. Blaxploitation films have such rich dialogue and so many amazing moments, it was easy to have a billion great quotes to sample. I used this disc to save some of them from the cutting room floor. One such track Big Daddy Kane Vs. Dolemite which didn't seem to fit anywhere on the other disc, was pretty much impossible to leave off of a compilation like this. Listen to the song and you'll understand why. Also included is Wu Tang affiliate Hell Razah's newest track; Cinematic, a true homage to these movies.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nDisc 3:\n\nThe third disc is the Fancore Pirate Radio special, hosted by critic and Blaxploitation enthusiast Jonny Botsch. The music is mostly compiled from the other two discs but with a completely different flow to the track selection. Also, as with most of Fancore's music related shows, they have radio commercials and trailers that fit into the theme of the show.  This episode wasn't constrained by any kind of time issue since the format was intended for a streaming podcast.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n=========================================================\n\nThe Research:\n\nIn preparation and all during the production of all three discs, I delved into my collection of films and even ordered several new ones online to add to the library. These are the movies that I took samples from or simply watched for more inspiration. Not all are great, but they are fun. So just in case you were wondering, this is the list of films:\n\nShaft, Shaft's Big Score, Shaft in Africa\nBlack Shampoo\nCoffy, Foxy Brown, Sheba Baby, Friday Foster\nCotton Comes To Harlem\nTruck Turner\nBlacula, Scream Blacula Scream\nBlack Belt Jones, Hot Potato\nBlack Samson\nThree The Hard Way\nEnter the Dragon\nGet Christie Love\nOriginal Gangstas\nBlack Mama White Mama\nSlaughter, Slaughter's Big Rip Off\nCleopatra Jones, Cleo and the City of Gold\nAcross 110th Street\nBucktown\nThe Big Doll House\nTNT Jackson\nBlack Dynamite\nJackie Brown\nVanishing Point (Not fully Blaxploitation but definitely a great movie and the radio DJ Supersoul is the main reason for it to be on this list.)\nThe Mack\nThat Man Bolt\n\nAlso highly recommended is Josiah Howard's book: Blaxploitation Cinema: The Essential Reference Guide. I found it to be comprehensive and thorough. Although I don\\'t agree with all of the reviews, (Bucktown for example was better than I expected having read the review first) there are so many movies covered and many that I had never heard of and a great breakdown defining these genre movies and chronicling their birth. There are also ten interviews with directors of Blaxploitation movies that is worth the price on the cover alone.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b7029f660923891abe569a65fb373915625a24f","amp;dn":"DJ+Sinatra+-+Blaxploitation+Mixtape+Deluxe+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b7029f660923891abe569a65fb373915625a24f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,112,41,246,96,146,56,145,171,229,105,166,95,179,115,145,86,37,162,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
