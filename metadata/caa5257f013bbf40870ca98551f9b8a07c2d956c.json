He\\\\\\'s a writer with writer\\\\\\'s block; his wife has left for her sister\\\\\\'s because he\\\\\\'s emotionally distant; he rarely answers his phone. A kennel sends him a border collie that\\\\\\'s undisciplined because of abuse. Despite a series of mishaps, Jon decides to keep trying with the dog, and he rents a dilapidated farm house to give the dog room to run. A local handyman refers Jon to a woman who might be able to help him train the dog. Reluctantly, Jon gives her a try. Is the dog the problem, or the owner? \n\n\nJeff Bridges\n\nLauren Ambrose\n\nLois Smith","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caa5257f013bbf40870ca98551f9b8a07c2d956c","amp;dn":"A+Dog+Year+2009+DVDRIP+XViD+-+TASTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caa5257f013bbf40870ca98551f9b8a07c2d956c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,165,37,127,1,59,191,64,135,12,169,133,81,249,184,160,124,45,149,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
