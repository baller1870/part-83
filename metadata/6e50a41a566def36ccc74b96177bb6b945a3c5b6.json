This time live from the country I was born, the Netherlands. Slagharen is from the tour just before the big comeback. And Meat is already hinting about the new Bat album. Shot with one camera. The sound starts out terrible but soon becomes soundboard quality. Unfortunately it's not complete. The concert starts halfway Masculine and Dead Ringer and the Rock n Roll medley are also incomplete and fade out. Paradise misses a few seconds during the play-to-play sequence.  The running time is just short of 90 minutes but we get a 14 minute exclusive interview with Meat.\n\nScreens:\n\n\nDVD: NTSC\nSound: Stereo\nChapters: Yes for each song\nCover: Included and created by me\n\nSETLIST:\n\n01 Masculine (fades in)\n02 You Took the Words\n03 Dead Ringer (incomplete)\n04 Midnight at the Lost and Found\n05 All Revved Up\n06 Heaven can Wait\n07 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n08 Rock n' Roll Medley (fades out)\n09 Interview with Meat Loaf\n\nCover:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e50a41a566def36ccc74b96177bb6b945a3c5b6","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+Slagharen%2C+the+Netherlands","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e50a41a566def36ccc74b96177bb6b945a3c5b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,80,164,26,86,109,239,54,204,199,75,150,23,123,182,185,69,163,197,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
