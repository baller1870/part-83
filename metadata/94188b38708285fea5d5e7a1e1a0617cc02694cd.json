The series also is a story of conflict, with Native American peoples, slavery, the Revolutionary War that birthed the nation, the Civil War that divided it, and the great world war that shaped its future.\nWritten by History Channel Publicity\n\n\n\n\n\n* INFO *\n----------\n\nORIGINAL TITLE ..: America The Story of US\nENGLISH  TITLE ..: America The Story of US\nRELEASE DATE ....: 01.11.2010\nMOViE YEAR ......: 2010\nGENRE ...........: Documentary\nPLAY TIME .......: 45 min / ep\nRESOLUTiON.......: 576x320\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641653/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1641653/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94188b38708285fea5d5e7a1e1a0617cc02694cd","amp;dn":"America+The+Story+of+Us+%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94188b38708285fea5d5e7a1e1a0617cc02694cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,24,139,56,112,130,133,254,165,213,231,161,225,160,97,124,192,38,148,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
