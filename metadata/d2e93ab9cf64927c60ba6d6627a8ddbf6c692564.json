There are lots of interviews, etc. of Bono by himself talking about the band, but this is meant to be about his work out side the band. \n\nThere are many volumes I've made of this stuff but the others were posted or are currently posted on U2torrents. The first 2 weren't allowed there because they contain a couple released things. I realize it is not customary to comment on posts here as it is on U2torrents, but it would be nice if you can, especially after you have watched it.\n\nB- indicates the day it was broadcast.\n\nThe text file here contains what is on all volumes.
