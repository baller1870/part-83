All the bugs mentioned either by email or in forum posts have been rectified and it should run fine.\n\nTake your time to read the manual if you need to know anything - I don't like tutorials in games so there's nothing holding your hand when you begin.\n\nI also hate grinding. Which is why I've kept it to the minimum. Although if you're one of these masochistic Koreans - You have the choice to increase the encounter rate; Something which you'll be rewarded for with a SUPER SECRET ENDING.\n\n\n\nVERSION LOG\n\n1.2.0.0\n\n== Vote for First Fantasy for Indie Game Of The Year 2010 on Indie/ModDB! == &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/games/first-fantasy-a-satirical-role-playing-game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.indiedb.com/games/first-fantasy-a-satirical-role-playing-game&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFixed Varian city castle bug where the bookshelf spontaniously combusted.\n\nFrom suggestion: I've added the feature to sleep in any of the Posidon's Curse ship beds.\n\nCorrected issue with floating text not updating properly.\n\nChanged The Great Cliche's room change point due to a game-breaking bug where if you parked the ship right next to The Great Cliche, you couldn't return to it.\n\nFixed issue with the Trilly and Surge cutscene not properly updating the cutscene end flag.\n\nGirl in Varian City is no longer confused over her gender.\n\nEdited dialogue between Trilly and Surge during the Catacomb cutscene.\n\n\n== FULL VERSION LOG INCLUDED IN README ==\n\n\n\nCONTROLS\n\nARROW KEYS - Movement\n\nX - Menu\n\nEnter/space - Use key\n\nA - Key used for twitch fishing\n\nSHIFT - Sprint\n\nF12 - Reset\n\n\n\nMAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE FONT FROM THE &quot;FONTS&quot; \nFOLDER!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e44100424f110907c6e34fd6fc17414265435463","amp;dn":"First+Fantasy+-+A+Satirical+Role+Playing+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e44100424f110907c6e34fd6fc17414265435463","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,65,0,66,79,17,9,7,198,227,79,214,252,23,65,66,101,67,84,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
