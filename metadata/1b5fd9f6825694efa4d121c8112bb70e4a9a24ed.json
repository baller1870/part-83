They play what I might describe as shoe-gazing electro-punk. If you know Serbian/ex-Yugoslavian rock, they might remind you a bit of Ekatarina Velika (a.k.a. EKV). Check out their videos on YouTube if you want to see if you would like them or not... \n\nThis torrent includes all 3 of their albums: E-Play (2000), Crime (2005) and Drago mi je da smo se upoznali (2009), meaning Nice to meet you. Also I have included a few extra songs like remixes, as well as a cover of the song Zemlja for an EKV tribute album which was done by a Serbian super-group, Crni Zub i Nova Mocna Organizacija, which includes members of E-Play among others.\n\n36 MP3s, 128-256 kbps\n\nAs always, if you like them and have a means to support them, then buy their CDs and songs and go see them play live.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b5fd9f6825694efa4d121c8112bb70e4a9a24ed","amp;dn":"E-Play+-+full+discography+%283+albums+%2B+bonus+songs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b5fd9f6825694efa4d121c8112bb70e4a9a24ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,95,217,246,130,86,148,239,164,209,33,200,17,43,183,14,74,154,36,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
