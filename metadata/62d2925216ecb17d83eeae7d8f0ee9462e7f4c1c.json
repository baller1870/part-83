Danny Schechter says the economic situation in the US is much worse than most people think. He says everything including the media is controlled by the big banks and companies. He believes that there is an information war going on and if they succeed in destroying WikiLeaks the next target is the internet itself. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://plunderthecrimeofourtime.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://plunderthecrimeofourtime.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.newsdissector.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.newsdissector.com/blog/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe .mp3 is extracted audio from the Press TV video.\n\nYou can watch the video at these links:\n\npart 1 of 3\n\npart 2 of 3\n\npart 3 of 3\n\n\n\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\nNot able to find a torrent of mine where or when you \nexpected it?\nCheck out my torrents blog for info about what I am\nuploading, tracker problems, etc..\n\nSome sites will not allow a blogspot URL in an \nuploaded torrent's description, so I have included \nthe blog's web address in a file included with this\ntorrent named:\nsebaygo1_TorrentsAndBlogInfo_ver2.pdf\n#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#%#\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n\n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
