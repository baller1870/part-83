He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the &quot;precious bodily fluids&quot; of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a &quot;Doomsday Machine&quot; which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers portrays the three men who might avert this tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert disaster depend on placating a drunken Soviet Premier and the former Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove, who concludes that &quot;such a device would not be a practical deterrent for reasons which at this moment must be all too obvious&quot;. Will the bombers be stopped in time, or will General Jack Ripper succeed in destroying the world ?  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=Dr+Strangelove&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=Dr+Strangelove&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a01925ef70a4bb79c309d74e096e841233a14f9","amp;dn":"DR.STRANGELOVE.OR.HOW.I.LEARNED.TO.STOP.WORRYING.AND.LOVE.THE.BO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a01925ef70a4bb79c309d74e096e841233a14f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,1,146,94,247,10,75,183,156,48,157,116,224,150,232,65,35,58,20,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
