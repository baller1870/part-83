Lolly Vegas, later to help found Redbone, plays lead guitar on the neat and hard-to-find cut by the Deuce Coupes. One of the latter-day efforts is a rare outing by Brian Wilson, who collaborated with Andy Paley for &quot;In My Moondreams.&quot; \nSeveral of those songs, it should be noted, can be found on better surf compilations (some on the Del-Fi label itself), but this is a respectable collection. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/893/frontwph.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/893/frontwph.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
