Ives argues Duvalier's presence will allow the United States and France to install their preferred candidate in a run-off election set for February against the wishes of President RenÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©val. The international community has threatened PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©val with exile if he does not comply with their interpretation of the disputed results of last November's election. &quot;PrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©val, after bowing to U.S. and French and Canadian dictates over the past decade of his presidencies, is now finding out that once he begins to resist a little bit or try to do something his way, that he's going to be quickly dispensed with,&quot; Ives says.\n\n\n- Gaza Doctor Izzeldin Abuelaish Two Years After Israeli Attack that Killed 3 Daughters &amp; Niece: &quot;As Long as I am Breathing, They are with Me. I Will Never Forget&quot;\n\nDr. Izzeldin Abuelaish was a well-known Palestinian gynecologist who spent years working in one of Israeli's main hospitals. On January 16, 2009, two days before the end of Israel's brutal 22-day assault on Gaza, his home was shelled twice by Israeli tanks. His three daughters and his niece were killed. He has just written a book about his life called I Shall Not Hate: A Gaza Doctor's Journey on the Road to Peace and Human Dignity. He joins us in our studio for an extended conversation.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b29200b318081131cada9f3ba3607436dc0de78","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+19+jan+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b29200b318081131cada9f3ba3607436dc0de78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,41,32,11,49,128,129,19,28,173,169,243,186,54,7,67,109,192,222,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
