Alexandria, 391: Hypatia teaches astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy. Her student Orestes is in love with her as is Davus, her personal slave. As the city's Christians, led by Ammonius and Cyril, gain political power, the great institutions of learning and governance may not survive. Jump ahead 20 years: Orestes, the city's prefect, has an uneasy peace with Christians, led by Cyril. The Christians enforce public morality; first they see the Jews as their obstacle, then women. Hypatia has no interest in faith; she's concerned about the movement of celestial bodies and the brotherhood of all. What place is there for her?\n\n\n=========================================================================\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186830/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1186830/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96c492a9fbf8ec874cbcb6318b38c8157b630269","amp;dn":"Agora+2009+-+dvdrip+-+arabic+subs+hardcoded","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96c492a9fbf8ec874cbcb6318b38c8157b630269","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,196,146,169,251,248,236,135,76,188,182,49,139,56,200,21,123,99,2,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
