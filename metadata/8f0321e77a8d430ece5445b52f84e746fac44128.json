But it's a hugely complex piece of work and Sebastien and\n      his team are working against the clock to complete this enormous\n      modern masterpiece in time for the memorial ceremony on 28th\n      June 2010. Alongside the tensions surrounding the building and\n      installation of this giant sculpture, the film follows the\n      moving true stories of the families who lost loved ones in the\n      disaster, and we hear the experiences of some of those who were\n      actually there at the time of the accident.\n      \n     \n                                                      Group Notes...\n        We are looking for:                           \n                                                                     \n      .EU Affil sites, NO COLO/RENTED.                              \n                                                                     \n      Retail TV dvds before the retail date.                        \n                                                                     \n      Can't get in contact with us?
