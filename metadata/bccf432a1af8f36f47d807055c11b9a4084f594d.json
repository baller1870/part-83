The album has a folksy vibe, and while folk isn't really my thing, the music is pretty good, and the lyrics are fairly exceptional. Lyrics that are not dumb are kind of rare these days, and they go a long way towards making a good album.\n\nI came across this CD in the basement of a record store in New York City. I picked it up because I thought it was interesting, and I'm very glad I did. I've been unable to find this album on any torrent sites, and it's really worth putting out there. These guys deserve to have better exposure.\n\n\nRipped from CD at 320 kbps.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n01 Chickenhawk\t\t\t\t5:03\n02 Tulips\t\t\t\t3:42\n03 Compromise\t\t\t\t3:20\n04 Lost in the Evening\t\t\t3:00\n05 The Lonliest Day\t\t\t3:42\n06 Three Cheers for the Cheated\t\t4:35\n07 Deeply Concerned\t\t\t4:46\n08 Early Bus\t\t\t\t3:24\n09 What Can You Say?\t\t\t4:03\n10 Any Agony\t\t\t\t3:44\n11 A Fish Called Hope\t\t\t4:46\n\n\n44:03 total time.\n\n\n- S.S.\n\n\n\nNote: My ISP has been throttling torrent traffic and closing ports on us, and I only own a laptop that I move around with. This means that seeding will be intermittent, but I will not abandon this torrent (at least not for a very long time from now). Have patience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bccf432a1af8f36f47d807055c11b9a4084f594d","amp;dn":"Fancy+Trash+-+Three+Cheers+for+the+Cheated+%282006%29+%28320+kbps%29+%5BSS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bccf432a1af8f36f47d807055c11b9a4084f594d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,207,67,42,26,248,243,111,71,216,7,5,92,17,185,164,8,79,89,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
