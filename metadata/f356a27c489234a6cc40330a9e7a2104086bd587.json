It was released on February 14, 1980 through Epic Records. It was the first album without Roger Fisher on lead guitar, who left the band months prior. The album was a commercial success, peaking at number five on the U.S Billboard 200 and staying in the charts for 22 weeks. The record contained the hit singles &quot;Even it Up&quot; (backed by the Tower of Power horns section) and the title track. Some of the backing vocals were provided by Don Wilhelm, who had been in a group called The Army with Steve Fossen and Roger Fisher in the 1960s. The album was re-released in an expanded edition in 2004. It contained two additional songs: A live version of Break and the studio outtake Jackleg Man.\n\nHeart is a rock band whose founding members came from Seattle, Washington, USA in the early 1970s. Going through several lineup changes, the only constant members of the group are sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. The group rose to fame in the 1970s with their music being influenced by hard rock as well as folk music. After diminishing in popularity for a couple of years in the early 80s, the band enjoyed a massive comeback in 1985, experiencing further successes with their power ballads and pop hits throughout the rest of that decade and into the 90s.\n\nOver their four decade career, Heart has had chart successes with a wide variety of musical styles, ranging from hard rock and metal (Barracuda, If Looks Could Kill, Black on Black II), to folk rock (Dreamboat Annie, Love Alive, Dog and Butterfly), to power ballads (Alone, These Dreams, What About Love). With both Jupiter's Darling in 2004 and their latest release Red Velvet Car in August 2010, Heart made a return to their hard rock/acoustic roots of the late 70s.\n\nTo date, Heart has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\nThe Wilson sisters grew up in Southern California and Taiwan before their Marine Corps father retired to the Seattle suburbs. After Ann graduated from Sammamish High School in Bellevue, Washington, she joined Roger Fisher in the band Hocus Pocus where she met Roger's brother Mike in 1971, and followed him back to Vancouver,Columbia, Canada. Meanwhile, Nancy finished high school then went to college where she majored in art and German literature. She then played solo gigs until 1974 when she quit college and moved to Canada to join Heart.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f356a27c489234a6cc40330a9e7a2104086bd587","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Break+%28Xvid-2nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f356a27c489234a6cc40330a9e7a2104086bd587","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,86,162,124,72,146,52,166,204,64,51,10,158,122,33,4,8,107,213,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
