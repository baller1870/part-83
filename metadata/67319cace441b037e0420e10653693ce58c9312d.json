A fresh take on the battle between man, machine and nature, this hard-hitting sci-fi thriller depicts a grieving American businessman in a Shakespearean showdown against the mad scientist that transformed him into a metallic killing machine. Being Tsukamoto's first English-language film, not much of THE BULLET MAN may make sense, but no viewer will be left unscathed after experiencing his particular brand of metal chaos. \n\n\nAudio :  English DD5.1\n\nSubs :      Japanese\n\njap. rental","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67319cace441b037e0420e10653693ce58c9312d","amp;dn":"Tetsuo+-The+Bullet+Man+2009+dvd%3Dsailo1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67319cace441b037e0420e10653693ce58c9312d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,49,156,172,228,65,176,55,224,66,14,16,101,54,147,206,88,201,49,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
