Another of Mori\\\\\\'s former pupils grew up to be notorious underworld figure Hugo Snyder (Rand Kingsley), who -- attempting to get the boys\\\\\\' FBI agent dad off his back -- orders the young ninjas kidnapped. In usual Disney fashion, the chopsocky children turn the tables on their inept kidnappers, but get in bigger trouble when a group of ninjas keeps them prisoner in the hold of a ship. Action-packed, but not overly violent, 3 Ninjas is a lot of fun for kids and its success at the box-office led to two sequels.\n\nRipped with DVD Decrypter and Autogk.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed82f5d1c48ad490b9cec9cf73bad1f007990f8","amp;dn":"3+Ninja%5C%27s%281992%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed82f5d1c48ad490b9cec9cf73bad1f007990f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,216,47,93,28,72,173,73,11,156,236,156,247,59,173,31,0,121,144,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
