Franciscan monk William of Baskerville and his novice Adso of Melk (narrating as an old man) arrive at a Benedictine abbey where a mysterious death has occurred ahead of an important theological Church conference. William, known for his deductive and analytic mind, confronts the worried Abbot and gains permission to investigate the death ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a young illuminator appears to have committed suicide. Over the next few days, several other bizarre deaths occur, and the two gradually discover that not everything is what it seems in the abbey.\nThe monk (played by Sean Connery) and his young apprentice (Christian Slater) also make the acquaintance of Salvatore (Ron Perlman), a demented hunchback who spews forth gibberish in various languages, and his handler and protector, Remigio da Varagine (Helmut Qualtinger) who, as events prove, also has a shady past. William quickly deduces that Salvatore had once been a member of a heretical sect and infers that Remigio likewise had been involved. He suspects that they may have been involved in the killings. Meanwhile, Adso encounters a beautiful semi-feral peasant girl who has apparently sneaked into the abbey to trade sexual favours for food; she seduces him, and he falls in love with her.\nInvestigating and keen to head off accusations of demonic possession the protagonists discover and explore a labyrinthine medieval library, constructed on multiple levels in the abbey's forbidden principal tower. William is astonished to find that it is &quot;one of the finest libraries in all Christendom&quot;, containing dozens of works by Classical masters such as Aristotle, thought to have been lost for centuries. William deduces that the library is kept hidden because such advanced knowledge, coming from pagan philosophers, is difficult to reconcile with Christianity. It becomes clear that the only remaining copy of Aristotle's Second Book of Poetics is somehow related to the deaths. William deduces that all of those who died under mysterious circumstances had read the book.\nHis investigations are curtailed by the arrival of Bernardo Gui (F. Murray Abraham) of the Inquisition, summoned for the conference and keen to prosecute those he deems responsible for the deaths. The two men clashed in the past and the zealous inquisitor ha no time for theories outside his own. Salvatore and the girl are found fighting over a black cockerel while in the presence of a black cat. Gui presents this as irrefutable proof that they are in league with Satan and tortures Salvatore into confessing. Salvatore, Remigio, and the girl are dragged before a kangaroo court tribunal where Gui intimidates the Abbot into concurring with his judgment of heresy. But William, also &quot;invited&quot; by Gui to serve on the panel of judges, refuses to confirm the accusations of murder. Gui resorts to extracting a confession from Remigio by the threat of torture, and clearly plans to take care of William for good, later.\nWhen another monk succumbs like the others, William and Adso ascend the forbidden library, and come face to face with the Venerable Jorge (Feodor Chaliapin, Jr.), the most ancient denizen of the abbey, with the book, which describes comedy and how it may be used to teach. Believing laughter and jocularity to be instruments of the Devil, Jorge has poisoned the pages to stop the spread of what he considers dangerous ideas: those reading it would ingest the poison as they licked their fingers to aid in turning pages. Confronted, Jorge throws over a candle, starting a blaze that quickly engulfs the library. William insists that Adso flee, as he manages to collect an inadequate armload of invaluable books to save; the volume of Poetics, Jorge, and the rest of the library are lost.\nMeanwhile, Salvatore and Remigio have been burned at the stake, and the girl is soon to follow, when the local peasants take advantage of the chaos of the library fire to turn on Gui and free her. Gui attempts to flee but they throw his wagon off a cliff, to his death. William and Adso later take their leave. A much older Adso reflects in his closing narration that he never regretted his decision to continue on with William, and that the girl was the only Earthly love of his life, yet he never learned her name.\n\n\nAllmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤nt\n FullstÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤ndigt namn               : D:\\Downloads\\Seeding\\I Rosens Navn.DVDrip.AC3-5.1.Norsk tekst.Rippet av Robban\\I Rosens Navn.DVDrip.AC3-5.1.Norsk tekst.Rippet av Robban.avi\n Format                          : AVI\n Format/                         : Audio Video Interleave\nFormat_Profile                   : OpenDML\n Filstorlek                      : 1,78 GiB\nDuration/String                  : 2 h 6 min\n Generell Bitrate                : 2 023 Kbps\n Skrivande applikation           : MEncoder version 4.0.0 building on 20100917\n Skrivande bibliotek             : [= DigiArty videodll!
