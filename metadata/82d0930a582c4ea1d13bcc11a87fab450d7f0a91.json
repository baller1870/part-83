Within seconds of the yearning start to The Gardner, you know \n\nyou're in the presence of something very special.\n\nA traditional ballad, it sounds like it could have been written yesterday such is \n\nthe freshness of tone and the lightness of touch that McShane exhibits. Her \n\nvocal is one that is conversant with the history and reputation of such a tune, \n\nbut is utterly unencumbered and far from intimidated.\n\nAway from McShane's sparkling performances, the core group of James \n\nPeacock (piano, keyboards), Jonathan Proud (bass) and Adam Sinclair \n\n(drums) provide supple and engaging support. The horn-augmented \n\nskitter-funk of Maid on the Shore wheels through tricky signatures as well as \n\nrocking it up as McShane herself tears off a blinding fiddle solo.\n\nElsewhere, elegant and understated arrangements Captain Ward, The \n\nDrowned Sailor and opener Miles Weatherhill wouldn't sound out of place \n\non an ECM label jazz album. Cool spacious keyboard runs, inquisitive and \n\nprowling bass, and neatly polished drumming not only lift the instrumental \n\nstakes, but serve to elevate McShane's voice.\n\nAnd what a voice.\n\nFolk music enthusiasts who've been around the block will be able to tell you \n\nwhere they were when they first heard Anne Briggs or Sandy Denny. In a few \n\nyears a new generation of listeners will be able to do the same when it comes \n\nto Rachael McShane.\n\nCD ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/rachael-mcshane/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/11/29/rachael-mcshane/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82d0930a582c4ea1d13bcc11a87fab450d7f0a91","amp;dn":"Rachael+Mcshane...No+Man%5C%27s+Fool%282009%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82d0930a582c4ea1d13bcc11a87fab450d7f0a91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,208,147,10,88,44,78,161,209,59,204,17,168,127,171,69,13,127,10,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
