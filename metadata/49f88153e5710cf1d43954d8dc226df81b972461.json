You have some &quot;post rock&quot;-y tunes in it, some classy ambient, some drones, some guitar tunes, analog-audio editing-ambient (making music with noise from the casette player) and even a 20 minute-monster-track. Note, that this'll probably not your style, it is very very experimental, based heavily on loops and some audio geek-ism (especially those tapemusic tracks). Except the tapemusic tracks, everything is done with a guitar and heavy audio editing. Maybe there are some tunes fitting to your personal taste. They all have the &quot;wasteland&quot; theme in it, for me atleast. I always had this in mind when recording them.\n\n\nFrank Schimski\n\n1-  Birds Song\n2 - In Vains\n3 - Birth Of A Star\n4 - 23 and 43\n5 - Finally We Know How To Delay Our Struggle\n6 - Let's Build An Ocean Full Of Flies\n7 - Kansas City\n8 - The Vats\n9 - Barbarossa\n10 - It Fades\n11 - Great Queen Elizabeth the XIII\n12 - White Mice\n13 - Ludwig&amp;Bartholomeus Part2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49f88153e5710cf1d43954d8dc226df81b972461","amp;dn":"Ancient+Horse%2C+Full+of+Glue.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49f88153e5710cf1d43954d8dc226df81b972461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,248,129,83,229,113,12,241,212,57,84,216,220,34,109,248,27,151,36,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
