Failing to read the fine print in his scholarship conditions, he finds he has no choice but to move to the remote and somewhat eccentric town of Cicely, in the wilds of Alaska. Once there, he is welcomed by the peculiar locals who are not keen to see him go, most especially Maurice Minnifield, the ex-NASA astronaut. Despite Joel's adamant denials, one gets the impression that he enjoys life in Cicely more than he admits.\n\nSeason 1: Originally aired in 1990.\n\nEpisodes:\n\nSeason 1, Episode 1: Pilot\nOriginal Air Date 12 July 1990\nA doctor from New York City adjusts to life in a rural town in Alaska.\n\t\nSeason 1, Episode 2: Brains, Know-How and Native Intelligence\nOriginal Air Date Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½19 July 1990\nDr. Joel Fleischman slowly starts accepting his desperately desolate fate, despite a defective shower leaving him to choose between swallowing his pride in order to get Maggie's plumbing help or bathing in the utterly icy lake. Popular DJ Chris Stevens' 'irreverent' comments on even Walt Whitman get him sacked from Maurice's radio K-Bear, but the boss soon offends everyone else in Cecily. Ed Chigliak's suave way gets reluctant Joel to make confusing house-calls on Ed's uncle, paradoxical medicine man Anku, who treats Joel to a Kentucky takeaway, traditional dancing and a sauna but refuses to be treated for his fatal cancer.\n\t\nSeason 1, Episode 3: Soapy Sanderson\nOriginal Air Date 26 July 1990\nDr. Joel Fleischman is depressed when grumpy old patient Soapy Sanderson completely ignores his medical advice, and is stunned when he and Maggie are named joint executors of his 140 acres forest estate where only wolves live. Maggie wants to turn it into a nature reserve, however un-required it is in this part of Alaska. Joel is rather tempted by the Indian chief Ronkomkoma's idea to turn it into a tax shelter by formally drilling for oil which everybody knows isn't there, hoping it may pay his way back to New York. Later Joel learns Soapy was a spirituality college professor for 20 years. Soapy also left them a $200 Lafitte-Latour for their trouble, which nearly works a romantic wonder, and a journal. Meanwhile the press gets interested.\n\t\nSeason 1, Episode 4: Dreams, Schemes and Putting Greens\nOriginal Air Date Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½2 August 1990\nShelly becomes pregnant and a wedding is arranged, but Holling has a deep-rooted fear - both his father and grandfather lived over a century, while their wives died young, leaving them alone and grieving for over sixty years each.

He becomes so busy trying to defend himself against the townspeople's charges that he is a KGB agent releasing the Russian flu upon them and competing with Marilyn over the best treatment for the illness, that he has no time to spend with his betrothed. Instead Maggie, entertains Elaine, which only further annoys Joel.\n\t\nSeason 1, Episode 6: Sex, Lies and Ed's Tapes\nOriginal Air Date Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½16 August 1990\nThere's much to deal with in Cicely when Shelly's husband arrives with the hopes of taking her back to Saskatchewan, much to the astonishment of Holling.

After Joel declines, he gets Chris to try, but although generosity gets them through the hard stuff, a game of croquet proves you can't adopt 'breeding'. When Ed tells Holling Jesse that the fiercest grizzly, who caused him to stop hunting anything else, is back, Shelly insists on joining them on a hunt which shows that although the men are older, the bear still knows them. Joel is asked to attend a hygiene class, but when he arrives learns it's for expectant mothers, which Maggie makes him improvise.\n\t\nSeason 1, Episode 8: Aurora Borealis: A Fairy Tale for Big People\nOriginal Air Date Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½30 August 1990\nWhile Joel gives Ed golf lessons, the Indian warns him Adam is around, the never actually seen monster-prankster, blamed for all kinds of weirdness since 15 years. Passing the night in his car in the woods after diagnosing a park ranger Burns, Joel is apparently robbed, actually taken in, by very human loner Vietnam vet Adam. Chris is delighted his instinctive sculptural inspiration fits the astronomical phenomenon Aurora Borealis (northern light). Chris accepts help from lost motor-biker Bernard, and discovers they share a lot, even an identity essential.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea1fa2d9c3acf6e5fd6f80f80962126fc483e359","amp;dn":"Northern+Exposure.Season+1.Nordic+Subs.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea1fa2d9c3acf6e5fd6f80f80962126fc483e359","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,31,162,217,195,172,246,229,253,111,128,248,9,98,18,111,196,131,227,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
