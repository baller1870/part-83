The material here stretches from the soulful American r&amp;b hits that first inspired the gritty-voiced singer to their modern progeny, emotive ballads like REM's &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and the compelling studio/live takes of U2's &quot;One&quot; that bookend the album. Cocker revisits old\ninspirations Lennon (&quot;Jealous Guy&quot; recast as warm, Caribbean-rhythmed r&amp;b) and McCartney (a grand, if less inspired &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot;), but it's on more vintage material like &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; and Lieber-Stoller's &quot;I Keep Forgetting&quot; and &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; that Cocker truly invests his considerable interpretative instincts. Jeff Beck solos with tasteful, typically elastic lyricism on the latter, while fellow ax icon Eric Clapton torches &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; with his own bluesy fire. But as brilliant as Cocker and his session cohorts (who also\ninclude Steve Lukather and Dean Parks) often are, their efforts sometimes skid on C.J. Vanston's way-too-slick production; aiming for the middle of the road, Vanston instead drives material like James Taylor's &quot;Don't Let Me Be Lonely&quot; and Cocker's otherwise lovely read of &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; towards a ditch. --Jerry McCulley\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.One                                                  [04:34]\n02.I (who have nothing)                                 [04:02]\n03.What's goin on                                       [05:13]\n04.Chain of fools                                       [03:46]\n05.Maybe i'm amazed                                     [03:22]\n06.I keep forgetting                                    [03:34]\n07.I put A spell on you                                 [04:32]\n08.Every kind of people                                 [04:19]\n09.Love don't live here anymore                         [04:15]\n10.Don't let me be lonely                               [03:40]\n11.Jealous guy                                          [04:07]\n12.Everybody hurts                                      [05:29]\n13.One (live)                                           [04:44]\n____\n\n55:37 min\n 79,3 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46e244e56c6ef372ee6b96639b8c34ae541514a9","amp;dn":"Joe_Cocker-Heart_And_Soul-%28Retail%29-2005-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46e244e56c6ef372ee6b96639b8c34ae541514a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,226,68,229,108,110,243,114,238,107,150,99,155,140,52,174,84,21,20,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
