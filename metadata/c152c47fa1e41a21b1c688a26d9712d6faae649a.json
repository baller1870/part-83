Her mother is an alcoholic. Quite often she doesn't have enough money in the supermarket. &quot;Ill never become like you&quot;, Katharina says to her, &quot;Id kill myself first.&quot; Her life would have no perspective whatsoever, if it wasn't for music. Katharina heard Mozart for the first time on Youtube - and was immediately fascinated by the emotional power of his music. One day she slips into the Gothenburg concert hall during a rehearsal. As if in a long passage from dark to light, she becomes immersed optically and acoustically in a totally different and fascinating world. Are you here for the interview as a receptionist, a woman asks her. \n\nKatharina seizes her opportunity. Yes, she answers, and improvises her new biography during the interview. Her mother was the famous concert pianist in Australia, Kelly Clarkson, who died from cancer when Katharina was two years old. She is given a six-month job on probation. At the coffee machine she gets to know the conductor, Adam. He sends her on her way with a Kierkegaard quotation, &quot;Courage is life's only measure&quot; (a sentence that will be quoted a few more times) and introduces the girl in a fatherly manner to the world of music and literature.\n\nBut his motives are not only educational. They kiss, and soon become lovers. For Adam, who is married, this is only a passing affair. But Katharina finishes with her boyfriend, who couldn't understand her passion for classical music anyway. Her love for Adam is - courageous and fearless in a Kierkegaardian sense - perfectly serious. And this leads to fatal consequences\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n                     _  _ ____ _  _ _ ____ ____ ____ _  _  ____ ____ \n                     |\\/| |  | |  | | |___ |    |  | |\\/|  [__  |___ \n                     |  | |__|  \\/  | |___ |___ |__| |  | .___] |___ \n\n                                                                            \n                                                                            \n\n                      Get the latest SWE(and Nordic) releases from\n \n                                   &lt;a href=&quot; http://moviecom.se&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://moviecom.se&lt;/a&gt; \n\n                                 SWEDENS FASTEST GROWING\n \n              _  _ ____ _  _ _ ____   ____ ____ _  _ _  _ _  _ __ _ _ ___ _ _\n              |\\/| [__]  \\/  | |===   |___ [__] |\\/| |\\/| |__| | \\| |  |   Y \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c152c47fa1e41a21b1c688a26d9712d6faae649a","amp;dn":"Till.Det.Som.Ar.Vackert.%282010%29.DVDRip.XviD.MovieCom.se","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c152c47fa1e41a21b1c688a26d9712d6faae649a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,82,196,127,161,228,26,33,177,198,136,162,109,151,18,214,250,174,100,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
