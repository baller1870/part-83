Meat Loaf only gave two concerts in the U.S. in 2001 and they were back to back in Caesar's Palace, Atlantic City on Sept 7 and 8. For some reason the recorder taped the last part on Sept 7th and the first part of the concert on Sept 8th. I put them in the right order of the set list and what is left is just a fantastic concert. Okay some songs are incomplete and it's missing 1 or 2 songs but besides that this is one of my favorite fan DVD's. This concert is the bridge between the Storytellers Tour and the Having Fun with Friends Tour. And Meat is having a ball. Great set, great interaction with the crowd and for an audience recording great video and sound! This is one to enjoy!\n\nNTSC DVD\nRunning Time: 76 minutes\nSound: Stereo\nChapters: yes (for each song)\nCover: Created and Included by me\n\nSET LIST:\n01 All Revved Up\n02 Life is a Lemon \n03 Lawyers, Guns and Money \n04 You Took the Words\n05 IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d Lie for You \n06 Anything for Love \n07 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n08 Rock and Roll Dreams \n09 Last Train To Clarksville\n10 Honky Tonk Woman \n11 Band Introductions \n12 Mercedes Benz\n13 Bat Out of Hell\n\nScreen:\n\nCover:\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9743c20ba80681ac3a0f7b14b1fce4fc6bd285d4","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+Atlantic+City+2001+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9743c20ba80681ac3a0f7b14b1fce4fc6bd285d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,67,194,11,168,6,129,172,58,15,123,20,177,252,228,252,107,210,133,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
