D9 is yet another good release by Diverse System, and there are a few very pretty tracks on the disc. This is yet another Bemani arrange album, but done well. As far as an overall theme to the disc, &quot;mysterious and wonderment&quot; would be fairly accurate. Give &quot;quasar -angelic blue mix-&quot; by Thanatos a check, as a work of some really engaging, violin-accented trance. The second highlight track is &quot;Ende&quot; by qurter (of RIGHT STUFF), for something a bit more uplifting. &quot;[SoftWare]STARFIELD&quot; is also nice.\n\nAll in all, a good album if you're a fan of pads, violins, and multi-layered lead synths in your trance music, hard to go wrong with D9 =]\n\nMake up your own mind on this album, there's sure to be something you'll like.
