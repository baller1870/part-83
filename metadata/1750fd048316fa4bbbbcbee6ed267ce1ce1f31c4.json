He lived for for some years inMemphis, where he recorded without outcome for Sun in 1952, but on becoming completly blind returned to Brownsville. It was therethat the documentary film-maker David Blumenthal, following a tip-off from Big Joe Williams, traced him in 1961. The word was passedto Bob Koester of Delmark Records and Estes soon afterwards embraked on a second voyage in music that would take him to festivals allover the US and to Europe and the Far East.This music, capturing the bluesman at the height of his creative powers. Unlike many Delta bluesmen of his era, Estes worked with a full jug band, which gave his music a greater variety of textures. His music swings, with a loose, relaxed feel that isn't heard on many Delta blues records. Furthermore, his songs are inventive, featuring pseudo-autobiographical lyrics loaded with evocative imagery. Nearly all of his best material is included on 'I Ain't Gonna Be Worried No More', making it as close to a definitive retrospective of Estes's music as possible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1750fd048316fa4bbbbcbee6ed267ce1ce1f31c4","amp;dn":"%28Blues%29+Sleepy+John+Estes+-+I+Ain%5C%27t+Gonna+Be+Worried+No+More","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1750fd048316fa4bbbbcbee6ed267ce1ce1f31c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,80,253,4,131,22,250,75,187,188,190,230,237,38,124,225,206,31,49,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
