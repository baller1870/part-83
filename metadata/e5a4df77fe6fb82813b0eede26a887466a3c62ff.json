Still, for those of us who love theatre, the chance to see the great stars perform live on stage is a great thrill. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve collected and ripped as many shows as I could find, and offered each of them as individual torrents. As you might expect, they donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t stay seeded for very long. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m offering up all I have in one large collection to help keep them out there. For individual torrents and show notes, you can find each show on The Pirate Bay.\n\nNot included but also available are the torrents for all five Nunsense Musicals, and a \ncollection of Noel Coward Stage Plays\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5751545/Noel_Coward_Collection_%287_DVD_BBC_Boxed_Set%29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5751545/Noel_Coward_Collection_%287_DVD_BBC_Boxed_Set%29&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5216856/Nunsense_-_Live_On_Broadway_-_All_Five_Musicals&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5216856/Nunsense_-_Live_On_Broadway_-_All_Five_Musicals&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nSome of these shows were recorded at regional tours, or in LondonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s West End, but I am using the BROADWAY label to define the genre. All of them are DVD rips of professionally filmed productions or TV specials, with the exception of the cam of Avenue Q, for which there is no official DVD.
