But the music that got left behind was substantial.&quot; For the first time, fans will have access to two discs containing a total of 21 previously-unreleased songs from the Darkness recording sessions, songs that, as Springsteen writes, &quot;perhaps could have/should have been released after Born To Run and before the collection of songs that Darkness on the Edge of Town became.&quot;\n\nHighlights include the extraordinary rock version of &quot;Racing in the Street,&quot; the never-before-released original recordings of &quot;Because the Night,&quot; &quot;Fire,&quot; and &quot;Rendezvous,&quot; the supreme pop opus &quot;Someday (We'll Be Together),&quot; the hilarious &quot;Ain't Good Enough for You,&quot; the superb soul-based vocal performance on &quot;The Broken Hearted,&quot; the utterly haunting &quot;Breakaway,&quot; and the now finally released, fully orchestrated masterpiece and title song, &quot;The Promise.&quot; All 21 songs have been mixed by Springsteen's long-time collaborator, Bob Clearmountain. According to long-time manager/producer Jon Landau, &quot;There isn't a weak card in this deck. 'The Promise' is simply a great listening experience.&quot;\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/c47c/c31591cc.png[/img]\n\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n\n01.
