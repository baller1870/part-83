They are plucking tea for multinational companies such as Lipton and FinlayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. The companies promise the consumers to protect the environment and ensure good working and living conditions for the workers. Nothing could be more wrong. The western consumers have turned to Fairtrade because Fairtrade/Max Havelaar guarantees, that the workers in the Fairtrade certified tea estates get a little extra money, every time the consumer buys their tea. This film tells the true story of how Fairtrade is not at all fair.\n\nDirector Biographical note:\nErling Borgen has worked as a journalist for more than 30 years, and was employed by NRK (the Norwegian Broadcasting Company) for 22 years.
