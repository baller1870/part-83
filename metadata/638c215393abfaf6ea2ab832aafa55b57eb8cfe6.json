Charlie Burden [Bobby Edner] is a typical    \n           eleven-year old boy growing up on a farm in Western            \n     Missouri. His summer days are spent helping his dad [Ron Perlman] run\n     the family farm, while also finding time to go fishing at nearby     \n           Miller's Lake, always accompanied by his faithful golden       \n           retriever, Old Drum. Scheming with his best friend Dee         \n           [Alia Shawkat] to build a       \n           secret raft, Charlie nearly drowns, only to be rescued by      \n           Old Drum. But Charlie's life is turned upside down when        \n           his cantankerous Uncle Lon [John Schuck] accuses Old Drum      \n           of killing his sheep. The town is divided over Drum's          \n           guilt or innocence, and an old family wound begins to          \n           fester. Losing sheep in this part of the country is not        \n           taken lightly. Looking to rid the town of a sheep killing      \n           menace, Lon files a lawsuit seeking to have Old Drum put       \n           to death. Desperate to save Old Drum, Charlie and his          \n           father try to obtain the services of one of the state's        \n           best known lawyers, George Graham Vest [Scott Bakula]. At first\n           hesitant, Vest is genuinely moved by Charlie's pleas to        \n           save his dog and agrees to take the case. As the trial         \n           progresses, the evidence mounts against Old Drum. Having       \n           exhausted all legal maneuvering, Vest has one chance           \n           left; his closing argument. Vest knows that this speech        \n           is a matter of life and death for Old Drum. As he turns        \n           to face the jury, he instills in the community and             \n           forever memorializes the phrase that &quot;A dog is a man's         \n           best friend.&quot;                                                  \n                                                                          \n                                                    \n                        \n                            \n                                 \n                                                                          \n           Bobby Edner................ : .Charlie Burden Jr. - young      \n           Ron Perlman................ : .........Charles Burden Sr.      \n           Randy Travis............... : ...Charlie Burden Jr. - old      \n           Alexis O'Keefe............. : ........................Ann      \n           John Schuck................ : ..................Uncle Lon      \n           Dick Martin................ : ...............Mayor Meyers      \n           Troy Evans................. : ...................Sherriff      \n           David Graf................. : ................Judge Henry      \n           Tom Dugan.................. :                                  \n           Kathy Garver............... : .................Aunt Katey      \n           E.J.
