It simulates both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems, provides a common infrastructure for a broad variety of tasks, including: microprocessor design; memory hierarchy design; component development and testing; automated software quality testing; SoC virtual prototypes; hardware-software co-simulation; and the development of firmware, drivers, and operating systems.\n\nKeygen included.\nLicense key should be generated for every user account wanting to use this program.\nNote: keygen is a Win32 EXE program, but the key iself is platform independent text file. So, you can generate the key on Windows machine and transfer it to the destination.\n\nThis software is made in 2007; therefore, operating systems issued later may not work in the virtual machine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c85f7fbc1061318332884c97162fa2c88c59ea29","amp;dn":"Virtutech+Simics+v3.0.29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c85f7fbc1061318332884c97162fa2c88c59ea29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,95,127,188,16,97,49,131,50,136,76,151,22,47,162,200,140,89,234,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
