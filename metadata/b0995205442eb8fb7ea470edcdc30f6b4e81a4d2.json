Although the band wears their influences on their sleeves -- the bluesy wail of Led Zeppelin and the lean, driving riffs of AC/DC being obvious touchstones -- Hooked is a consistently rocking, high-quality mainstream hard rock album. It didn't achieve the commercial heights of its predecessor, probably because of the lack of one instantly recognizable killer single on the level of &quot;Once Bitten, Twice Shy&quot; or &quot;Rock Me,&quot; but Hooked still stands as one of Great White's best efforts. Highlights include &quot;Call It Rock N' Roll&quot; and Desert Moon.&quot; \n  \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Call it rock N' roll [03:57] \n 02.The original queen of sheba [04:40] \n 03.Cold hearted lovin' [04:20] \n 04.Can't shake it [04:45] \n 05.Lovin' kind [04:46] \n 06.Heartbreaker [06:45] \n 07.Congo square [06:58] \n 08.South bay cities [05:26] \n 09.Desert moon [04:32] \n 10.Afterglow [05:50] \n ____ \n \n 51:59 min \n 79,8 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0995205442eb8fb7ea470edcdc30f6b4e81a4d2","amp;dn":"Great_White-Hooked-%28Retail%29-1991-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0995205442eb8fb7ea470edcdc30f6b4e81a4d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,153,82,5,68,46,184,251,126,164,112,237,205,195,15,107,78,129,164,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
