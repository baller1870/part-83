The group is led by Rick Grimes, who was a sheriff's deputy in King County, Georgia, before the zombie outbreak. As their situation grows more and more grim, the group's desperation to survive pushes them to the very edge of sanity. At every turn they are faced with unspeakable horrors, both from the undead and the scattered remains of a struggling human populace.\n\nMain cast\nAndrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes\nJon Bernthal as Shane Walsh\nSarah Wayne Callies as Lori Grimes\nLaurie Holden as Andrea\nJeffrey DeMunn as Dale Horvath\nSteven Yeun as Glenn\nChandler Riggs as Carl Grimes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97e6a3edb4d1b1cd28b3e306058d89e3a27d457c","amp;dn":"The+Walking+Dead+Season+1+720p+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97e6a3edb4d1b1cd28b3e306058d89e3a27d457c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,230,163,237,180,209,177,205,40,179,227,6,5,141,137,227,162,125,69,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
