Each week special agent Alex Cranston and her team of espionage misfits take on a mission vital to national security. They go where others can't go. They do what others won't do. And they screw up in ways that can only be described as world class. But like all great spy heroes, Alex and her NISA team get the bad guys and make Canada a safer place. Just not always on purpose.\n\n- Above Suspicion is three-part crime drama in which DI Anna Travis is reunited with DCS James Langton for another challenging case. The shooting of an ex-police officer leaves a notorious drug dealer as the obvious suspect. However, Travis is convinced that things are not as they appear and that something much bigger is at stake. But as she strikes out on her own, tensions within her team threaten to derail the case.\n\n- The Thin Blue Line was a British sitcom starring Rowan Atkinson set in a police station that lasted for two seasons from 1995 to 1996. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01622c6cd088c12d7f34506507afa51c1e46f131","amp;dn":"TV.Shows.Pack.Jan.4.H264%5BCHOOSE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01622c6cd088c12d7f34506507afa51c1e46f131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,98,44,108,208,136,193,45,127,52,80,101,7,175,165,28,30,70,241,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
