How could this tragic turn of events have happened? And what does it tell us about the way mentally ill inmates are treated in a prison system that was once the envy of the world? With the inquest into Ashley SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s death set to begin, the fifth estate has obtained critical videotape footage that shows SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time in prison and brings unique insight into the full extent of this tragedy.\n\nConvicted at only 15 years of age, Ashley SmithÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s original 30-day sentence stretched to four years and included 17 separate transfers by Corrections Canada within a year. In the most in-depth examination of her tragic story yet, the fifth estate also examines the little-known 114 days she spent in early 2007 at the Regional Psychiatric Centre (RPC) in Saskatoon. The only psychiatric hospital in the country with a therapeutic healing program designed for women offenders, RPC had Smith locked in segregation after clashing with guards and staff. Shocking revelations come from former nurses, one social worker and a former warden, all of whom stepped forward to share their stories for the first time. \n\nOne tip received by the fifth estate led the team to another seriously at-risk RPC inmate whose story is also told as part of the broadcast.\n\nHana Gartner takes a look at the troubled life that Ashley Smith led behind bars and the sad circumstances surrounding her death.\n\nFile Information\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 353 MiB for 45mn 0s 290ms\nSource            : CBC HD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 953 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b229486167bbc2fb65eff912fa1fb8f7d6a8d5d","amp;dn":"the_fifth_estate.S36E07.12.Nov.2010.PDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b229486167bbc2fb65eff912fa1fb8f7d6a8d5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,34,148,134,22,123,188,47,182,94,255,145,47,161,251,143,125,106,141,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
