Pop. 1,999 was founded by St Lenon of Padua, when he fell into the river at this spot in 953. Ballylenon is situated on the shores of Lough Swilly with entrancing views of Muckish Mountain, in the Diocese of Derry and Raphoe. (Note: Ballylenon is a fictional name, but the other landmarks are identifiable.)\n\nIn this society, there exists an uneasy balance of interests. Communication has all the appearances of power, and in Ballylenon, communication means the local Telephone Exchange and Post Office. Both these are firmly in the control of sisters, Vera and Muriel McConkey, who in cahoots with hotelier and funeral undertaker, Phonsie Doherty, would seek to rule the roost in Ballylenon. However, other forces have their own guiding principles, and where the McConkey sisters and Mr Doherty, aided by The Vindicator, would dominate reactionary thinking, a dangerous liberal tendency is championed by Vivienne and Rev. Samuel Hawthorne, and the somewhat unlikely, Guard Gallagher. The antagonism between these camps is only ever thinly veiled.\n\nThe series was written by Christopher Fitz-Simon, and it starred T. P. McKenna, Stella McCuscker and Margaret D'Arcy.\n\n\nBallylenon - S01 - E01\nBallylenon - S01 - E02\nBallylenon - S01 - E03\nBallylenon - S01 - E04\nBallylenon - S01 - E05\nBallylenon - S01 - E06\n\nBallylenon - S02 - E01\nBallylenon - S02 - E02\nBallylenon - S02 - E03\nBallylenon - S02 - E04\n\nBallylenon - S03 - E01\nBallylenon - S03 - E02\nBallylenon - S03 - E03\nBallylenon - S03 - E04\n\nBallylenon - S04 - E01\nBallylenon - S04 - E02\nBallylenon - S04 - E03\nBallylenon - S04 - E04\n\nBallylenon - S05 - E01\nBallylenon - S05 - E02\nBallylenon - S05 - E03\nBallylenon - S05 - E04\nBallylenon - S05 - E05\nBallylenon - S05 - E06\n\nBallylenon - S06 - E01\nBallylenon - S06 - E02\nBallylenon - S06 - E03\nBallylenon - S06 - E04\nBallylenon - S06 - E05\nBallylenon - S06 - E06\n\nBallylenon - S07 - E01\nBallylenon - S07 - E02\nBallylenon - S07 - E03\nBallylenon - S07 - E04\nBallylenon - S07 - E05\nBallylenon - S07 - E06\n\nBallylenon - S08 - E01\nBallylenon - S08 - E02\nBallylenon - S08 - E03\nBallylenon - S08 - E04\nBallylenon - S08 - E05\nBallylenon - S08 - E06\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 0s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nResolution : 16 bits\t\t\n\n[\n\n\nI post quite a few torrents if this site is down when I post a new one I don't have time to keep trying.\nIf it's down then it's skipped.\n\nYou can follow me on Twitter so you don't miss any\n\n\nOr add the RSS feed in uTorrent (In FEEDS on the left add)\n\n\n\n.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ed5ef142e708e6f449b52fbef04271da89b8520","amp;dn":"Ballylenon+-+S01+to+08+-+Audio+Comedy+-+MP3+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ed5ef142e708e6f449b52fbef04271da89b8520","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,213,239,20,46,112,142,111,68,155,82,251,239,4,39,29,168,155,133,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
