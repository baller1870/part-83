Most are referring to real people and real incidents. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not pulling too many punches here. The melodic SNAIL slant is very much in evidence, although with less keyboard textures and more guitar. All in all, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a great deal more raw and organic.  HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the track listing:\n\n01.\tWhen She Left You\n02.\tMomentum\n03.\tI Believe In Love\n04.\tEvensong\n05.\tSpeak To Me\n06.\tMy Master Plan\n07.\tPatrick\n08.\tOh Jenny\n09.\tWe Never Really Leave\n10.\tKenneth\n11.\tThe Sound Of Warm\n\nAs ever, all songs, performances and production by me. Even the sleeve design. Free to you my friends. Thank you for your friendship and support. Hope you like it.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nDavid\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe8e2c7f855e112439eba0c387349eec8842ec1a","amp;dn":"Snail+-+Momentum+-+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe8e2c7f855e112439eba0c387349eec8842ec1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,142,44,127,133,94,17,36,57,235,160,195,135,52,158,236,136,66,236,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
