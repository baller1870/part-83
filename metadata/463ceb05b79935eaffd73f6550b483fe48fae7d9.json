The same discography will also include tracks previously signed by Junkyard, tracks that have been on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œArpegautÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ album and hereby reinterpreted in a R.O.A. characteristic manner.\n\nThe compositions are both common and separate, based on inspiration. Bogdan is also the director of the video created for the track entitled ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢We like itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and he will also contribute to the visuals part of the project, while Cezar will perform the primary vocals. \n\nIn January 2011, the band intends to include two more members, responsible for the electronic elements of guitar sounds and live drums. The voice, the synthesizers, the acoustic drums and the electric guitar will therefore contribute as signature elements to the 100% Live concerts that are to follow. Up to any further changes, the ROA project shall perform with two members, as DJ Gigs.\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:463ceb05b79935eaffd73f6550b483fe48fae7d9","amp;dn":"HOUSE+-+ROA+-+We+Like+It+%28+Official+Video+%29+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"463ceb05b79935eaffd73f6550b483fe48fae7d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,60,235,5,183,153,53,234,255,215,63,101,80,180,131,254,72,250,231,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
