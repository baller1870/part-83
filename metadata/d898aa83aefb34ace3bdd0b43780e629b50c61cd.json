Darlington (vocals, guitar, bass, bass clarinet, etc.) and wife Laura B. Darlington (vocals, alto flute, toy piano, omnichord, etc.) who are often joined onstage by Amir Yaghmai (violin &amp; falsetto), Jonathan Larroquette (computer machines) and Andres Renteria (percussion).\n\nThe Long Lost\nNinja Tune\n2009\n\n1.
