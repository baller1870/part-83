I can upload the bonus disc if I get some feedback from you guys.  This is my first torrent.

Original and unmodified.\n\nI also am into customizing windows installation discs and using them to install without having to download updates and such, so if there are any requests for custom windows install discs, I'd be happy to fulfill those requests.\n\nI DO NOT\n\nlet me repeat that\n\n...I DO NOT:\n\nOFFER ANY KEYS, KEYGENS, CRACKS, MODS, OR SERIALS THAT BYPASS PRODUCT IDENTIFIERS\n\nEnjoy this torrent, and if it has success, I will probably upload more","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56b4595941f19eeb44dfa6edf61c87ff8c6e5c2c","amp;dn":"Unreal+Tournament+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56b4595941f19eeb44dfa6edf61c87ff8c6e5c2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,180,89,89,65,241,158,235,68,223,166,237,246,28,135,255,140,110,92,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
